Chemical engineering is a very diverse field.   Industries that hire chemical engineers include bulk and specialty chemicals, polymer manufacturing, electronics, petroleum refining, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, cosmetics, and many others.   However, they also can be found in consulting and process design firms, federal and local governments, equipment manufacturing companies, etc.   Many chemical engineers will start their careers as    process engineers   , specializing in a particular process at a plant that makes a product, for example a particular polymer sheet, drug active ingredient, or lotion.   The engineer will be responsible for making sure the process runs smoothly and recommending process improvements.   However, there are also many other types of positions that a starting engineer might fill, such as working for a design firm, a controls company, or even in a hospital or other facility where PET or other advanced imaging systems that require the use of chemical and radioactive tracer compounds.   It is difficult to find an industry where chemical engineers are not found.   Many students also go on to pursue advanced degrees in medicine, pharmacology, or research in government, industrial and academic laboratories. How Can I Become a Chemical Engineer? Students interested in pursuing a chemical engineering degree need a strong background in mathematics, chemistry, physics, and for some specializations, biology.   Good writing and general problem solving skills are also important as well as an appreciation of the global nature of the modern world and how technology impacts our environment.   All of these things start with a solid high school education and an interest in learning that will last a lifetime. Chemical engineering programs are typically four years culminating in a bachelor   s degree. Some students attend a community college for the first two years and transfer to a bachelor   s program.   Many students also participate in a cooperative education program where they alternate semesters on campus with paid employment at companies in the chemicals and process industries.   The University of Tennessee has a particularly strong and active cooperative education program so be sure to investigate this option if you are interested.   It gives students first-hand insight into what they will do in their careers and an appreciation for how the knowledge they gain in their classes is applied later in their jobs. How is Chemical Engineering Different from Other Disciplines? Chemical engineers study many fields that are common to other engineering and science majors.   They take chemistry through organic and analytical chemistry. They take multi-variable calculus and differential equations.   They also take thermodynamics, fluid flow, and physics including some electrical circuits and optics, as well as statics and dynamics. The coursework that is unique to chemical engineering is the study of how mass is transported and how it distributes between phases (important in the design of separations equipment in particular) and in the combination of reaction kinetics with the design of reactor equipment.   The field of biology is also becoming important in chemical engineering as we search for new processes to manufacture materials and fuel modern technology with less environmental impact. How Do I Know if Chemical Engineering is a Good Career for Me? Most chemical engineers are strong in basic sciences such as math and physics, as well as having an interest in chemistry.   As discussed above, biology is also becoming more important and many students go on to advanced training in biomolecular engineering.   Biomolecular engineering includes the development of new drugs, new vehicles for the delivery of new drugs, the engineering of biological systems for energy and chemicals production, and other fields as well.  highlight  Additional Resources If you think a career in chemical engineering might be a good choice for you, but want to look into it more, the following links might be helpful  What do Chemical Engineers Do?

Progression of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering students to departmental upper division courses is competitive and is based on capacity. Factors considered include overall grade point average, performance in selected lower division courses and evidence of satisfactory and orderly progress through the prescribed curriculum. Upper-Division Status  A lower-division student may apply for progression to Upper-Division Status after completing CBE 201, 235, 240 and 250 with a grade of C- or better in each course and an overall GPA of 2.3. Provisional Status  Students who have completed CBE 201, 235, 240, and 250 with an overall GPA of at least 2.1 may apply for provisional status. The granting of Provisional Upper-Division Status is based on the availability of space in the departmental programs after Upper-Division Status students have been accommodated. Provisional students are required to demonstrate the ability to perform satisfactorily in upper division courses by completing a total of seven departmental courses with a grade of C or better in each course (including the four required for Upper-Division Status). Permission to continue with upper-division classes depends on this minimum level of performance. Any student with an overall GPA below 2.1 will not be admitted to upper division Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering courses. Students who have not been admitted to Upper-Division or Provisional Status will be dropped from upper-division departmental class rolls. Transfer students at the upper-division level are admitted on a Provisional Status basis only.

Students who have achieved upper division status in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering with an overall GPA of at least 3.7 and a GPA of 3.5 in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering classes may elect to participate in an enrichment program involving small seminars and research in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. Students are required to register for at least one credit hour of CBE 407, Honors Seminar, which involves attendance at seminars on various topics of interest to Chemical and Biomolecular Engineers. The research component may be met by registering for CBE 467, CBE 488, or CBE 498 under the direction of a faculty member.   Note that CBE 488 also fulfills the senior design requirement. An overall GPA of 3.5 must be maintained throughout matriculation to continue in the honors program. Interested students should consult the honors coordinator for details about participation. In order to have your degree titled  BSE CBE Honors  you should use the  Honors  form of the Degree Audit Reporting System (DARS).

The following statement on American history is taken from the undergraduate catalog  Effective July 1, 1978 and afterwards, all students receiving a bachelor   s degree must have completed one unit of American history on the high school level or six semester hours of collegiate American history in order to receive a bachelor   s degree as required by the General Assembly of the State of Tennessee (Tennessee Code Annotated Section 49-3253). This means that students who graduated from a high school that did not require American history must take two courses in U.S. history at the univeristy in order to receive their B.S. degree. This usually applies to international students since they frequently do not have any previous U.S. history courses but some U.S. students may also fall into this classification.   collapse   collapse title=  What are these CEEs that I ve Been Hearing About?

Increasingly, Chemical and Biomolecular Engineers are becoming licensed as Professional Engineers, (P.E.) through their state registration boards. Most of these boards (including Tennessee   s) have four requirements to become licensed as a P.E.  Graduation from an accredited engineering degree program Successful completion of the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) examination Four years of engineering experience Successful completion of the Principles and Practice of Engineering examination For more information, see the web sites for the National Society of Professional Engineers (NSPE) and the  Tennessee State Board of Architectural and Engineering Examiners. A Professional Engineer is expected to participate in continuing professional education. Requirements vary somewhat from state to state, but the Tennessee Registration Board requires completion of 24 Professional Development Hours (PDH) of acceptable continuing education every two years to maintain one   s P.E. license. One Professional Development Hour is equivalent to 50 minutes of instruction and can include credit or non-credit courses, seminars, professional meetings, etc. The American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) recognizes the importance of continuing education by sponsoring courses    designed to advance the practice of chemical engineering, to maintain high professional standards, and to keep chemical engineers and allied professionals abreast of new and emerging technologies.    You can visit their continuing education home page. Our goal in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at UT is to prepare you for all facets of your future professional career. We have instituted a Continuing Education Experience (CEE) requirement for all our undergraduate students. This requirement is intended to prepare you for a lifetime of learning by giving you a flavor of the experiences required to maintain professional licensure. Each spring and fall semester that you are enrolled in one of the gatekeeper courses listed in the table below, you will be required to complete 5 CEE   s as defined on the attached sheet. Failure to do so will result in a reduction of your course grade by one full unit for the associated gatekeeper course  e.g., if you would have obtained a grade of B+ had you completed the 5 CEE   s, your grade barring completion of the CEE requirement would be reduced to a C+. Each semester, you must print off a Continuing Education Reporting form for the designated key course in which you are enrolled. You should record your CEE   s on the form and turn it in to the instructor at the end of the semester by a specified deadline. You should keep the original forms along with announcements, programs, etc., to accumulate in a Continuing Education Portfolio throughout your undergraduate career. This will be useful to show to prospective employers when you are interviewing for a job. By completing CEE   s, you will learn a great deal about the wonderful, exciting and challenging field of chemical engineering, its related disciplines, and the interrelationships between science, engineering, and the world at-large.

Now, it has a hall of fame to help honor and share that legacy. John Prados, a UT vice president and University Professor emeritus, has been named the inaugural member of the hall for his sixty years of service to the department as a teacher, administrator, and university icon.    It is hard to find words to express my appreciation for this honor,    said Prados.    Words like    overwhelmed    and    speechless    come to mind.    I want to express my deep gratitude to the department for this recognition, because what I have accomplished over the past sixty years could not have happened without the help and support of my faculty colleagues, the departmental staff, and especially my students, and they all share in this honor.    One of the oldest chemical engineering programs in the South, it became its own department in 1936, one year after starting its master   s degree program. A doctoral path was created in 1949, the first such PhD offered by any institution in Tennessee, public or private. Prados joined the department as a graduate assistant in 1953. He quickly climbed the ranks in both the department and the college, serving as a full-time faculty member from 1956 to 1968 before spending the next two decades in stints as associate dean of engineering, dean of admissions and records, acting chancellor of the Knoxville and Martin campuses, acting director of energy conversion programs at the UT Space Institute, and, from 1973 through 1988, vice president for academic affairs of the statewide UT System.    The faculty in the department wanted him to be the first and only person elected to our hall of fame in its inaugural year,    said department head Bamin Khomami.    It   s an acknowledgement of his standing in the field as well as his outstanding contributions to our program over many decades.    Surprisingly enough, that long career at UT almost didn   t happen. Prados said he   d planned to go into the petrochemical or petroleum industry on the Gulf Coast after finishing a two-year stint in the Air Force. But fate intervened. A faculty member suddenly left the department for an industry job, and then   department head Robert Boarts offered Prados the job.    My career at UT was totally unplanned,    said Prados.    I had enjoyed some part-time teaching while in graduate school, and although the pay was only about two-thirds of my industry offers, there were good possibilities for research support and consulting at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, so I took the job.    Except for two periods of leave   one to work at ORNL and one with the National Science Foundation   I have been here ever since.    He returned to the department full time in 1989, serving as its department head from 1990 to 1993. A native of Spring Hill, Tennessee, Prados is a fellow of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AiCHE), the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET), and the American Society for Engineering Education. He has received the L.  E. Grinter Distinguished Service Award, UT   s Macebearer Award, and the James T. Rogers Award from the Commission on Colleges. In other higher learning institutions, Prados has been a member of the Board of Trustees of the Southern Association of Schools and Colleges, a trustee of the F.  W. Olin College of Engineering, and an executive councilor of Tau Beta Pim as well as advising more than thirty other universities, government entities, and industries. Outside academia, he has served as the National Science Foundation   s senior education associate in its Engineering Directorate, as director and treasurer of the AiCHE, president and treasurer of the scientific research society Sigma Xi, chair of the Engineering Accreditation Commission, and secretary and president of ABET. To be considered for the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering Hall of Fame, a person needs to hold a degree from the department or a department at another college with a sustained relationship with UT, have a minimum of ten years of experience in engineering, have been recognized by peers or by honorary societies, and not be an active faculty member at UT.","link":"http:\/\/cbe.utk.edu\/prados-first-member-of-chemical-and-biomolecular-engineering-hall-of-fame\/"},{"title":"Paddison Appointed RSC Fellow","content":"Paddison Appointed RSC Fellow Dr. Stephen J.

That   s according to Matthew Neurock, who spoke at the department   s 2017 Troy C. Trotter Distinguished Lecture to a captive audience of students, faculty, and staff members this September. In his lecture, titled    Engineering Molecular Transformations over Supported Catalysts for Sustainable Energy Conversion,    Neurock presented information on recent advances in computational catalysis and the ways these can be applied to engineering molecular transformations for energy conversion and chemical synthesis. He addressed the sites and nanoscale reaction environments necessary to carry out specific bond-making and breaking reactions, plus processes important to the control of the catalytic conversion of biomass to chemicals and the electrocatalytic transformations of fuels to energy. Neurock is the Shell Professor of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science at the University of Minnesota (UM). He received his doctorate from the University of Delaware in 1992, worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands from 1992 to 1993, and as a visiting scientist in the Corporate Catalysis Center at DuPont from 1993 to 1994. He joined the chemical engineering faculty at the University of Virginia in 1995 before joining UM in 2014. Neurock has made seminal advances to the development and application of computational methods toward understanding catalytic and electrocatalytic reaction mechanisms and the sites and environments that carry out reactions under working conditions. He has received various awards for his research in computational catalysis and molecular reaction engineering and co-authored over 250 papers, two patents, and two books. He served as an editor for the Journal of Catalysis for 10 years and continues to serve on numerous other editorial and advisory boards. The lecture series was established by the Trotter family to honor alumnus Troy C. Trotter (BS,    47). The lecture provides CBE with the opportunity to invite nationally recognized experts to UT for the benefit of students, faculty, and the local professional community.

Cong Trinh, Ferguson Fellow and associate professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering, is developing a method to greatly improve the time involved in both identification and removal of such pathogens through the concept of a Virulent Pathogen Resistance program, or ViPaRe.  In an age when pathogens can be a weapon, having a rapid response is absolutely vital,  Trinh said.  Our goal is to be able to identify and target such threats within weeks rather than years, while at the same time not harming the host.  Through ViPaRe, devices are being designed using a blend of statistics, computer science, mathematics, chemistry, and biology. That broad mix is required since the machines must be capable of taking samples, identifying which pathogens are present, and attacking them at their genetic core. Supercomputers, with their ability to make calculations and break down data millions of times faster than human researchers, make the concept possible, according to Trinh.  It currently takes a long time to analyze small molecules, which is unacceptable if you re talking about facing an epidemic,  he said.  We are developing specialized software and using  smart  machines to dramatically reduce diagnosis and response times.  Taking such a targeted, specialized approach to fighting pathogens has other benefits, such as curtailing the rise of antibiotic-resistant microbes, since Trinh s method attacks them genetically instead of via medicine. ViPaRe would also allow treatment to change as diseases mutate, eliminating potentially hazardous new outbreaks of old illnesses. For example, while flu outbreaks occur every year the severity of those outbreaks differs because variations in the strain make it time-consuming for officials to figure out exactly which strain they are facing and produce the correct vaccine. Using Trinh s idea, medical personnel would be able to take blood samples, identify the particular strain, and eliminate it within weeks rather than over the course of months. In recognition of his work on ViPaRe, the US Department of Defense named Trinh a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Young Faculty award winner for 2017. This award program provides funding, mentoring, and industry and DOD contacts to awardees early in their careers in order to develop research ideas in the context of DOD needs. Trinh also earned the 2017 American Society for Engineering Educators Southeast New Researcher award, which recognizes a faculty member who has less than six years of teaching and research experience but has demonstrated excellence in both.

The basic idea of being able to quickly  imprint  images on a target remains the same. But researchers like Gila Stein, the Prados Associate Professor of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, have helped take it to a modern level. Originally, images were transferred by pressing a plate prepared with a variety of substances into a  target  plate coated with fats. The prepared plate would then etch the image into the transfer plate, allowing mass production of images or text. Now, light is projected through a series of optics on to thin films of photo-sensitive polymers atop a silicon wafer, producing silicon chips.  Light triggers a chemical reaction, which is the first step towards forming patterns,  said Stein.  Our goal is to understand how the properties of thin polymer films control the progression of these chemical reactions so we can predict how new materials will perform.  It s all part of a broader field of research into the understanding and design of functional polymer films for electronics, energy, membranes, and coatings. Stein   s research group also works with materials called block copolymers that can form patterns and arrays on their own at the nano-level. Gaining an understanding of how these systems self-organize in thin films   two-dimensional layers of polymers   holds endless possibilities. The films can complement lithography in the manufacture of next-generation electronics and can be adapted for controlled use in electronics and sensors.  Polymer systems have the potential to impact a number of different fields,  Stein said,  but they are also pretty complex. We use techniques like X-ray scattering, infrared spectroscopy, and microscopy to examine structure across multiple length scales, from individual molecules to millimeters.  Stein noted that faculty and researchers within the department and at ORNL can help build off one another to improve such research.    We work with faculty in the department to model chemical reactions in thin films, and to study self-assembling polymers that could be used in batteries,    said Stein.    We also collaborate with research groups at Rice University and Oak Ridge to study the surface properties of branched polymers, which are useful in the design of responsive surfaces.    Just another way that Stein and her research group are proving that small things can make a big difference.

She is the inaugural member of the department   s Student Service Hall of Fame.    I now have the opportunity  of hopefully  inspiring current and future CBE students to give to the department and grow professionally,    she said. The Student Service Hall of Fame highlights students who exemplify service to their community. McBride, now in her first year as a medical student at the UT Health Science Center College of Medicine in Memphis, certainly fits the bill. While working on her chemical engineering degree with a concentration in biomolecular engineering, the Seymour, Tennessee, native also maintained a position as a Tickle College of Engineering student ambassador and took on a major leadership role as chair for the 2017 Southern Regional AIChE Conference.    I loved working toward a successful conference to help my community in undergrad,    she said.    Planning such a large-scale event was new to me. The greatest challenge was time management. I was focused  on doing well in classes my senior year, but also spending every extra moment in Dougherty working on the conference.       We invented the Student Service Hall of Fame because we did not feel that we had an award that was commensurate with the effort and impact that Mary made on our department through her work on the conference,    said Associate Professor Eric Boder and AIChE Student Chapter advisor.    We had a really great team of students working on our conference planning committee, but every team needs a dedicated and effective leader to function well. Mary worked tirelessly for roughly a year, with a constant smile on her face and positive attitude, making arrangements and planning every detail of the event.    McBride had attended other regional and national AIChE conferences, but many other CBE students had not been able to go.    Having the conference in Knoxville allowed for our students to get highly involved in the planning process,    McBride said.    It was most satisfying to see my peers get involved in AIChE in a more in-depth way than just our local student chapter.    The conference gave UT engineering students the opportunity to network and present research to peers from other universities as well as representatives from industry and graduate schools. McBride looks back on the experience as a definite success.    Undergraduate students from all over the southeast commented on how smooth events went and how much fun they had,    she said.    I think our successes in organization of Chem-E-Jeopardy, research presentations, tours of ORNL, and the Chem-E-Car competition originated from the care we took in planning each event. We wanted students to feel excited about being in Knoxville and at UT. This made for a great conference, but also numerous opportunities for graduate recruiting for the college.    Part of the success could also be attributed to the inclusive sense of community that McBride helped foster, even before the conference got underway.    In our program book, there was a letter welcoming the students to Knoxville and to UT,    she said.    I made it a point in the letter to let visiting students know that, here, they are a part of the Volunteer family.       The result was an event that showcased our department and our college to hundreds of students and faculty from many states,    Boder said.    Within three weeks of the conference, more than a dozen attendees had submitted formal inquiries regarding graduate studies at UT.

What, then, might it mean to be able to operate everything from vehicles to houses by a device whose only output beyond the energy it makes is water and heat? Fuel cells hold such promise. The growth and development of fuel cell technology is one of the big waves in science right now, with UT positioned as a leader of the armada of institutions pushing its boundaries. Led by UT-ORNL Governors Chair for Electrical Energy Conversion and Storage Tom Zawodzinski, the Zawodzinski Group in CBE has made several advancements in fuel cell design, particularly in polymer electrolytes, electrodes, and catalysts. Much like a battery, fuel cells have an anode and a cathode and a membrane that both separates and facilitates the reaction between the two, producing power. Where they differ from a battery is that, as their name implies, they use fuel and air to complete the reaction, and in fuel cells the anode is negative and the cathode positive. Any improvement in a few key components could have groundbreaking effects on the technology   s adaptation as a whole.    Currently, about one-fourth of the power generated is lost during the reaction,    Zawodzinski said.    The materials and techniques we are working on should help us eliminate that to a large degree, which will make the cells more efficient and cost-effective.    Hydrogen is pumped into the anode side, while oxygen from air is introduced into the cathode side. Their reaction produces electricity, water, and heat, making them ideal in a number of ways. Cars, for instance, could be powered in such a way that the only exhaust was water. Houses could use them to provide all three necessities, something of particular interest given recent recovery efforts following hurricanes. In such cases, having fuel cells at the ready could provide help, especially power and water, weeks or even months before such services might otherwise be restored.    In many ways, fuel cells are like engines, only you aren   t burning anything to make the process work, so it   s much smoother, much more efficient, and has no harmful exhaust,    Zawodzinski said.    The technology for basic fuel cells has been around for years. NASA used them on the Apollo missions, for example. The key is to make that next great leap forward, technologically speaking.    At the heart of fuel cells lies the proton exchange membrane, or PEM, which allows only positively charged ions to pass from the anode to the cathode. Electrons, separated from the fuel at the anode, take an alternate path to the cathode, which completes the circuit and produces energy. Currently, PEM fuel cells utilize platinum to varying degrees in their design, especially at the cathode where the oxygen reacts slowly, but Zawodzinski   s group is developing a new type of cathode built with less expensive yet more efficient materials. While the ability to provide basic needs for a house is one eventual target, the tweaks the group is making at the PEM level will have a major impact all its own. Each PEM test cell is about the size of a dime, while a real world single cell might have an area the size of a place mat.    This is a game-changer for both us and the technology itself,    Zawodzinski said.    The idea we have could improve output anywhere from 30 to 50 percent. At that point, the idea really becomes practical in an everyday consumer sense.    Some challenges still remain, however. While fuel cells can be filled up the same way one might currently fill a gas tank, Zawodzinski said that in the US only California has really committed itself to establishing a    corridor    of hydrogen filling stations in place for vehicles. To get other states on board might require the next big advancement in fuel cells. Zawodzinski and his team have a message for those yet to get on board  challenge accepted.

These are materials that can be easily deformed by thermal stresses or thermal fluctuations at around room temperature. Whether it   s a dying cell phone battery or a broken refrigerator, most people know there   s room for improvement. CBE faculty members are making great strides to do this. Take, for example, the cutting-edge investigations into polymeric liquids being done by Bamin Khomami, Beaman and Granger Distinguished University Professor and department head, and Brian Edwards, professor and associate department head. These bizarre materials can display physical properties of both solids and liquids and, thus, are the basis of production for a myriad of consumer products such as plastic containers, clothing, packaging materials, structural components, furniture, building products, and more. Using the power of some of the world   s fastest supercomputers, Edwards conducts simulations to understand how these materials behave in their molten state during industrial  processing. A better understanding of this can lead to more efficient industrial processes   and thus better products  for you and me.    New and improved models of polymeric flow behavior will result in the industrial production of new and improved products that will benefit everyone,    he said of his NSF-funded research. For example, products can become stronger, miniaturized, and functionalized.    Imagine a thin plastic wire the thickness of a hair that is stronger than steel and could conduct electricity.       Brian Edwards. Work by other CBE researchers also promises to improve the products we use in our daily lives. Associate Professor Manolis Doxastakis is looking to unlock the potential of elastomers, or rubbers. Using computational methods, he examines their molecular level structure and then predicts their macroscopic behavior. Specifically, he tries to answer    what if    questions by modifying the coupling of polymers and particles to change the material   s behavior. He also uses computational modeling to try to improve semiconductors by examining how small molecules move through a thin polymer film that   s undergoing a chemical reaction.  His findings could lead to better everyday products from tires to computers.     We are aiming to improve performance, lower cost, and preserve the environment.       Manolis Doxastakis Assistant Professor Joshua Sangoro   s work is also aiming to make soft materials better but he   s looking at something different   ionic liquid, or liquid salt. His work holds promise to improve almost every corner of our technological world.    I   m of the opinion that there are ionic liquids suitable for nearly every technology. The task is to find the optimal one.       Joshua Sangoro But, the task is almost akin to finding a needle in a haystack. Ionic liquids have a large variety of potentially available cations and anions, which means they hold the possibility of creating trillions of chemically distinct materials, each with different properties and uses.    This  vast  number  of  chemical  structures  require scientific design criteria based on understanding of the correlation between structure and desired properties,    Sangoro explained. He leverages the power of an experimental technique called broadband dielectric spectroscopy to understand the relationship between the ionic liquid   s chemical structures and the resulting properties. This method is only being used by a handful of researchers in the country and uniquely probes the response of materials to electric fields through a wide range of timescales. Timescales determine the dynamics  and hence, they determine many physical properties of materials, including the extent to which a material can conduct and  store electrical energy. Sangoro   s work, supported by  research grants from  the National Science Foundation and the  US Army Research Office,  will lay the scientific groundwork for new materials used in  batteries that need less time to charge but hold much more energy.

Those lag times in identifying and responding to diseases weren   t acceptable to Cong Trinh, so he set out to find ways of speeding up the process. He and his team wanted to improve the issue while making sure that any increase in diagnosis didn   t come at the cost of health and safety. One of the most recent examples of that work is the Virulent Pathogen Resistance program (ViPaRe) that he developed that combines a wide range of math, science, and computing to more readily identify cellular invaders and help eradicate them before they have a chance to spread.    Time is everything when it comes to stopping disease, both on an individual level and in terms of outbreaks and epidemics,    said Trinh.    By utilizing technology to analyze small molecules, we are creating    smart    equipment that can adjust diagnosis and treatment in a much faster manner.    Some of Trinh   s earlier work could also have an impact on the medical field. He received a 2015 CAREER award from the National Science Foundation for his work in helping further push a concept known as modular cells. As part of that, Trinh is developing microbial manufacturing platforms, basically a series of different cells that can be exchanged and utilized as needed for various purposes.     The basic idea behind building microbial platforms is that they allow a far more efficient biosynthesis of materials. That improvement not only means that you can make them quicker, but that in doing so you can make more of them and bring down overall cost.       Cong Trinh One product that is more easily produced through the use of such interchangeable platforms is a group of substances known as esters. While his original focus was to develop more cost-effective esters for use in solvents, flavors, and biofuel production, esters are important players in healthcare. The ester salicylic acid acetate is perhaps the most common painkiller in the world, known better as aspirin. Other medicinal uses of esters include treatments for arthritis and nervous disorders. Even their importance to the artificial flavor industry has ties in the medical field, with many otherwise bitter medicines being made palatable by the use of esters. So while Mary Poppins might credit sugar for helping the medicine go down, true credit goes to chemical and biomolecular engineering.","link":"http:\/\/cbe.utk.edu\/trinh-tackles-cells-at-their-core\/"},{"title":"Love is Orange","content":"Love is Orange by Laura Tenpenny    I was a bit confused until I discovered the card signed by Coach Fulmer, and then I realized that someone must have reached out to UT,    said Charles Shaw (BS ChE    80). His daughter contacted his old chemical engineering department on a quest to lighten her father   s spirits as he went through treatment for cancer. In a feat of administrative coordination and love, the department worked with other units around campus to send Shaw care packages and cards from the university and from his fellow UT chemical engineering alumni.    It boosted my pride in my university that the folks there care enough about an old alumnus and die-hard Vol fan to take time from their busy jobs to make my day a little brighter,    Shaw said of this show of support. As a wide-eyed student, he was similarly overawed by the university.    Coming from a small town like I did, UT exposed me to so many new ideas and people and opened up a world of opportunity for me,    Shaw recalled. Part of that opportunity included participation in the engineering co-op program, through which he was able to work for TVA.    UT gave me my career. My experience at UT provided the educational background and the vocational awareness through my co-op experience to prepare me for the successful engineering career I have enjoyed over the past 38 years,    Shaw said. Since leaving UT, Shaw has worked for TVA, Porex Technologies, and Osmose, with experience in plant design, product design, operations management, and more. Of most importance to him, however, is his family, which includes his wife, Lynne, and his daughters, Honey and Maggie. People are also what Shaw considers most important when he reflects on his time at UT, and especially his recent experience as an alumnus.     I think the people make UT special. While the gesture of reaching out to me during a tough time may seem insignificant to some, I believe it is part of the make-up of everyone who has ever been associated with the Volunteer family. I love the University of Tennessee and am proud to be part of the Vol nation and believe it is our duty to help each other. I know I certainly appreciate the effort that has been shown on my behalf.     Charles Shaw Shaw   s cancer is responding well to treatment, and he wants his Vol family to know that he is doing well. He expressed his gratitude for all involved in the kindness he received     Thank you for your interest in me and my situation. I am grateful for the life that my time at UT prepared me for and I just want to continue to pay it forward to help others and exhibit that Big Orange spirit while I do it!

The three most recent recipients exemplify these qualities and appreciate the incentive to maintain their pace. Hadi Sefiddashti received the McKinley award in 2017 for his contributions to understanding the strange behavior of entangled liquids. Unlike the constant viscosity of an ordinary liquid like water, more complex liquids    viscosity can change with the strength of their flow. It   s important to know how these will act in industrial devices like an extruder.    I   m focused on understanding the flow behavior of these on a molecular level,    said Sefiddashti.    We need to understand molecular mechanisms in flow in order to understand the strange phenomena that we see in polymeric liquids.    His earlier research background was not directly in this area, and Sefiddashti thanks his advisor Brian Edwards and co-advisor Bamin Khomami for guiding him in the right direction.    They have helpful and deep input,    he said.    They tell you where to start to understand a problem.    The McKinley award recognizes Sefiddashti   s ongoing achievement in examining these liquids.    I   m honored and very grateful to receive this award,    he said, adding that the resources offered by the CBE department are geared for success.    I had good coworkers in my research group, and facilities that we needed for research were available for us.    Nelly Cantillo, PhD student and 2018 McKinley recipient, stays motivated with the knowledge that her work adds to the development of the next wave of renewable electrochemical energy-storage and generation devices.    My dissertation examines the interaction between the electrode components in proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) and the impact that these interactions can have on the electrode structure and ultimately, on the overall PEMFC performance,    Cantillo explained. The award recognition invigorates her academic spirit.    As an international student and first-generation college graduate, pursuing my PhD degree has been a challenge for me,    said Canitllo, who earned her master   s and bachelor   s degrees in her native Colombia.    Receiving this award motivates me to keep working hard for my goals and set an example for the next generation in my family and my home country.    Cantillo credits her research advisor Thomas Zawodzinki as her mentor, and has worked closely with faculty like Gabriel Goenaga, Stephen Paddison, and Joshua Sangoro.    These interactions inside and outside the classroom have contributed to my professional and personal development,    said Cantillo.    Working in a diverse and dynamic environment have made a difference in my experience as an international student in the US.    Cantillo is active in the Pipeline  Vols for Women in STEM student organization, leading the creation and coordination of a program to promote early-career mentorships between graduate students and postdocs or faculty in STEM. She also served as tutor and mentor to middle school and high school students in different outreach programs. Said Cantillo,    I am passionate about encouraging and inspiring women to pursue careers and higher education in STEM fields.    McKinley winner Tyler Cosby joined the CBE graduate family in 2013 as the first PhD student in Sangoro   s newly established research group. He investigates the development of structure-property relationships in soft matter.    In hydrogen-bonding and ionic liquids, I have discovered new experimental signatures of the slow motion of these extended structures,    he said.    This provides new insight into these important materials and will allow us to better design them for application in emerging technologies such as batteries, fuel cells, and super-capacitors.    Cosby appreciates the company this award puts him in.    I have an immense amount of respect for the students selected in past years and am honored to be among them,    he said.    I   m especially thankful for all of the effort that Professor Sangoro has expended on my behalf and the faith he has shown in my ability to grow and achieve my goals.    Cosby has participated in two other CBE department research groups and has worked with the college   s HITES12 summer pre-college.    As part of that program, I worked with other students in my lab to develop and lead high school seniors in a week-long lab-based introduction to soft matter research,    he said. Cosby maintains a keen interest in the teaching and learning aspects of his UT journey. The department chose him to receive a GAANN fellowship for teaching and research in an area of national need.    As part of this program, I have been a teaching assistant for four semesters and participated in several programs offered by the graduate school and the Teaching & Learning center at UT,    he said.

They were recalled but the threat still exists    in every smart phone we use. Well, actually, in a lot of things we use. The source of the explosion was the failure of the lithium ion battery   the standard kind of battery used in many tech products.    The batteries    electrolytes have numerous carbonate additives,    explained Joshua Sangoro, assistant professor.    One of the major problems with those is that when mixed with lithium ion salts, spontaneous chemical reactions are known to occur at temperatures as low as 140 degrees Fahrenheit. These reactions release hydrofluoric gas which is highly toxic and can easily catch fire.    In addition, after recharging the battery a couple of times, some root-like patterns called dendrites begin to grow from one electrode towards the counter-electrode of the battery. This leads to an electrical short-circuit characterized by sparks. Fueled by the accumulated hydrofluoric gas and other flammable electrolyte constituents, the sparks ultimately lead to explosion of the lithium ion battery. There   s got to be a better, safer way to power our technology, and Sangoro   s work is getting us closer to that way.    I would really like to make an impact in changing the type of electrolytes that we have   or be able to design new ones that aren   t as dangerous as the current ones we use,    he shared. The answer lies in salt. Liquid salt, that is. Also known as ionic liquids, these materials have low vapor pressure, are electrochemically stable, non-flammable, form a layer around electrodes to prevent the growth of dendrites, and remain liquid in a wide temperature window. This all means there   s no danger of them spontaneously combusting. What   s more, they consist of negatively and positively charged ions rendering them electrically conductive   a key requirement for rechargeable batteries. However, because ionic liquids consist of large molecules, the electrical conductivity is low compared to standard electrolytes. So, Sangoro is researching the impact different molecular structures have on ionic conductivity. All with the goal of designing a better, safer battery. Sangoro and his team of students are doing this by leveraging the power of an experimental technique called broadband dielectric spectroscopy. This method, only being used by a handful of researchers in the country, enables them to alter the molecular structures by exposing the materials to electric fields through a wide range of timescales. Knowledge of timescales is crucial to understanding the physical properties of materials including how much electrical energy a material can store and conduct.     We apply a small electrical field to disturb the molecules and then monitor how the molecules get back to their equilibrium positions. The goal is to find ways of designing ionic liquids with higher ionic conductivity.       Joshua Sangoro Pinpointing optimal energy storage and conductivity in ionic liquids is almost akin to finding a needle in a haystack. Because they have a lot of positively and negatively charged ions, the liquids hold the possibility of creating trillions of new chemically distinct materials with different properties and uses. This makes them very promising for improving all types of technology but also very difficult to study.    This vast number of chemical structures require scientific design criteria based on understanding of the correlation between structure, interactions, and desired properties,    explained Sangoro. Sangoro   s team consists of postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate students supported by grants from the National Science Foundation and US Department of Defense. Sangoro says engaging with students inside the classroom and the lab is one of the most rewarding parts of his job.    It   s amazing when you see the students understand the concepts when they arrive not knowing any of them,    he shared.    It is really gratifying.    Also gratifying? Making our world a safer and better place to live.    Science should be useful ultimately to society, and we should understand the basics of how everything works so that we can make steps forward.    Sangoro is working on it.","link":"http:\/\/cbe.utk.edu\/sangoro-adds-extra-salt\/"},{"title":"Faculty News","content":"Faculty News The American Association for the Advancement of Science named UT   s Bamin Khomami, the head of the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, as a 2018 Fellow.

While it still seems farfetched to think such a scenario might ever be possible, the reality is that research being done by people like assistant professor Siris Laursen has lead to breakthroughs that are turning concepts that once seemed unimaginable on their heads by taking new approaches to science. Laursen   s work is in the realm of catalysts, materials that help improve the speed and efficiency of a huge range of chemical processes without being consumed by the transformation, meaning they can be used over and over again. From fuel to food, catalysts have played a key role in shaping society since the dawn of the industrial revolution, but one of the things preventing them from having an even greater impact is the cost of the catalysts themselves.     The most widely-used material in catalysts for many decades now is platinum. It has served its purpose, but it comes with limitations, not the least of which is its price tag.       Siris Laursen Laursen has proposed a new tactic, using computers to explore possible catalysts at the atomic level, studying information on their surface areas and gaining data about their performance. His method also includes combining two or more metals in preparing the catalyst, giving his team increased flexibility in fine-tuning the finished product based on what the computer modeling shows to be the most effective design. This development of using what is known as intermetallic compounds also opens up the use of catalysts in areas where platinum has historically not performed as well or at all, leading to seemingly endless possibilities.    The approach we are taking will reduce our reliance on such an expensive material, while at the same time giving us the ability to do new and exciting things,    said Laursen.    The use of emerging materials will allow us to keep up with changing needs and demands.    Chemicals, rubber, foam, medicine, and yes, even one day turning garbage into fuel, are just the start of how Laursen   s work could change our own future.","link":"http:\/\/cbe.utk.edu\/laursens-a-catalyst-for-change\/"},{"title":"All Data All The Time for Abel","content":"All Data All The Time for Abel Steven Abel is a model researcher, literally. His group creates physical or mathematical models at some of the smallest levels imaginable, helping researchers gain a better understanding of how cells behave.    Our first goal is to solve the riddle of how cells recognize one another,    said Abel.    For example, we know that white blood cells are able to tell when something bad has entered the body and distinguish that from other cells, we just don   t know how they do it.    The group is exploring the idea that identification is based on cells being able to recognize amino acid sequences in other cells. Those sequences vary by protein, and so would show up differently from substance to substance. Abel   s team correlates their data with what is known to be true in the medical field to help assure accuracy of their models, then uses that to try different approaches to finding the best result. While many scientific breakthroughs come from someone    thinking big,    Abel   s group took the opposite approach and thought small. How small? Consider a newton, the measurement of how much force is required to give one kilogram of mass an acceleration rate of one meter per second, per second. Abel   s team carries out observations measured in piconewtons, a force one one-trillionth the strength of a newton.    To be able to do research at the minute levels of cells that we are talking about, we had to think small,    said Abel.    No one has done it at this scale before.    Abel   s methods have a number of other advantages as well. By using data and modeling, they can not only experiment until they find something that works, but they can better explore why ideas that failed were unsuccessful and use that to make a better attempt the next time. Furthermore, since the cells in question exist as data-driven substitutes for their real counterparts, the modeling can be used to simulate humans, animals, or plants, allowing for greater collaboration.     We can and have worked across departments and colleges, including with people in biology, chemistry, even agricultural-related efforts,    said Abel.    The ability to simulate any cell structure could help in things such as improved crop yields, disease-resistant plants, or even more productive biofuels.        Steven Abel Abel noted that, like any emerging field, there are unexpected challenges, but that he sees the newness of the concept as an opportunity to position his group   and UT   as a trailblazer.","link":"http:\/\/cbe.utk.edu\/all-data-all-the-time-for-abel\/"},{"title":"The Foundation","content":"The Foundation After agreeing to write this article, I have thought a lot about what should be in a career reflection.  As you will see, I have decided to focus mainly on my early years.  I expect that most of the people that read this probably know my recent history but were probably not yet born when I started my career journey at UT 50 years ago. Charlie Moore September 2018 50 Years    Last May I retired from UT after almost 50 years of service.  The last 10 of those years I have been on a post retirement gig that thankfully has allowed me to continue to be involved on a part time basis. I enjoyed every aspect of my career at UT but what I will miss the most is the classroom. There are many dimensions to an academic career but I personally found none more rewarding or more challenging than facing a classroom full of bright young people My Path Here  I joined the UT faculty in December of 1968 after completing both my undergraduate and graduate work at LSU. I did not expect nor did I even entertain the possibility of an academic career. I fully expected to accept a job as a chemical engineer for one of the many companies located in south Louisiana.   Fortunately, during my junior year I took a couple of classes that literally changed my life. I was blown away by both the teacher and subject matter. Paul Murrill was a new faculty member doing pioneering research on using digital computers to automatically control chemical processes. I was hooked and wanted more so I applied to the graduate program to study under Murrill. It worked out well. A couple of years later, I had a PhD, a dissertation, a half a dozen published papers and was about to start a teaching job at the University of Tennessee that would last almost 50 years. Graduation Surprise   I had not considered the possibility of an academic career until a month before graduation. My graduation was unexpectedly early. By the fall of 1968 all the technical requirements of my PhD requirements were complete except for one foreign language exam. At that time all PhDs were required to pass a written exam in two foreign languages. Thanks to high school French, and a flashcard review of vocabulary, I was able to barely pass the French exam but I had made no progress on the second. Fortunately, that fall the graduate school was quietly at the very beginning of a process of changing those requirements. I managed to get the second language requirement waved with the argument that I was married, had two kids, and urgently needed find a job. Interview Cloaked in Mystery   With the encouragement from Murrill, I wrote letters to schools that I thought would be interested in my background. Shortly afterwards I scheduled three campus visits all in the first week in November. My interview at UT was on November 5th,  which was election day, the day Richard Nixon was to be elected to his first term as President. My visit to Knoxville was a little strange. Besides being election day, when I arrived on campus I was welcomed by the Dean and Department Head and immediately asked to not disclose to anyone that my visit was a faculty interview. The problem was that UT was not ready to announce that the position in ChE was open. Bad Optics but Good Timing   At the time of my interview, the war in Vietnam was raging and there was tension on campuses all over the country. The UT community was abuzz after Dick Gregory, comedian and an outspoken critic of the war, was controversially disinvited by the administration to a talk scheduled on campus. In response the administration agreed to have a student faculty committee draft a new speaker policy. John Prados, whose position I was to fill, was the chairman of that committee. The problem was that John was to be promoted to be the Associate Dean of Engineering and the optics would have been bad if that had been known before the committee   s report. By the way, Prados and Murrill were undergraduates together at Ole Miss. The two of them schemed to have me apply for the yet unannounced opening in chemical engineering. I owe both thanks for much more than my academic start. Both have been enormously helpful to me both personally and professionally throughout my career. Choosing Tennessee   After a frantic week of interviews Tennessee became a clear choice. Because of the mystery surrounding my interview I didn   t have much of a chance to meet the faculty or graduate students, but I liked the campus and I loved the idea of raising my family in East Tennessee. But by far the most appealing part of UT   s offer was the possibility of quickly establishing a research lab. Back then the department was a combination of Chemical, Metallurgical, and Polymer Engineering. A year earlier the department had been awarded a large DOE grant for new research equipment. I was invited to use the remaining funds to establish a research facility. It was turbulent times but a few months later I had purchased a small computer system and with the help of the departmental shops it was interfaced to equipment in the unit operations laboratory. I recruited a few students and my research was off running. Turbulent Times   I suppose the beginning of most academic careers could be well described as turbulent. The job of assistant professor is a poorly defined mixture of teaching, research, and service. It comes with no clear guidelines or instructions other than a personal tenure clock that is ticking loudly in the background constantly reminding you that you have about six years to prove yourself worthy. Also, like most new faculty, I was also starting a family. My wife was in graduate school preparing for her own academic career and we had two precocious preschool age children that needed their share of attention. In addition to the turbulence of starting a new job and a new family, I began my career at UT during very turbulent times, politically. The news backdrop for my early years included the war in Vietnam, the draft lottery, the Watergate break in, the secret White House tapes and growing calls for Nixon   s impeachment. UT was not insulated from the turbulence. There were peace rallies and protests on campus almost daily. In an effort to minimize the influence of outside agitators there was a period early in my career where a person without a valid UT ID could be escorted off campus. In May of 1970 protest on campus made the national news. Just weeks after Kent State students were killed by the National Guard, Billy Graham held one of his Crusades in Neyland Stadium. Nixon spoke at one event, sparking the largest anti-war protest in Knoxville   s history. It led to 50 arrests and a free-speech case that almost made it to the Supreme Court. UT   s Athletic Board   Throughout my career students have been curious about my football days at LSU. Yes, I did play defensive back on the infamous Chinese Bandits squad. There will be more to follow about that experience but for now it does explain why shortly after I arrived on campus I was asked to serve on UT   s Athletic Board. I was named the chairperson of the Committee on Academics. It didn   t take long to find out that the one thing that the chair of that committee was not supposed to do was ask questions about academics. At LSU I had just witnessed how unfairly academics were used to regulate scholarship obligations. Hopefully, times have changed, but back then there was a limit to the total number of football scholarships and they could be revoked for only two reasons  breaking    team rules    and not meeting    academics standards.    Of the 63 or more recruited in my freshman class, fewer than 8 of us still had scholarships when we left LSU. Bursting Bubbles    Another aspect of my turbulent tour of the Athletic Board had to do with plans in the mid-70s to encapsulate Neyland Stadium with a bubble. It turned out that the chairperson of the committee on academics was also an ex-officio member of the UT   s Board of Trustees. The first and only meeting I attended was the meeting in which the Neyland bubble was discussed. I soon found myself face to face with Cornel Tom Elam, the crusty old Chairman of the Board, trying to explain some of the objections that faculty had to the spending money on a bubble.   The News Sentinel had a headline the next day    Moore Burst Bubble.    I expect that clipping is in a scrapbook box in the attic. Perhaps I will find it before these reflections go to print. Unlikely Combination   Yes, I played football at LSU while studying chemical engineering. Doing both was probably my biggest claim to fame in both football and in chemical engineering. But no apologies from me. I got a good education and played on some very good football teams. We finished in the top 10 and went to a bowl game all three years that I played on the varsity. My junior year we played Syracuse University in the Sugar Bowl. We beat Syracuse that year and again in my senior year we beat Arkansas in the Cotton Bowl. I had the personal problem that many of my relatives, including my father, went to the University of Arkansas. That Cotton Bowl loss to LSU ended their bid for a national championship that year. My relatives still remember and blame me for that loss. I lettered three years and was named an Academic All American my senior year, but to be honest I was never a star at the college level. I did, however, play against some big named stars that some of you old timers may still remember. I played against Jim Nance and Floyd Little of Syracuse, Joe Namath and Kenny Stabler from Alabama, George Mira of Miami, Bobby Crockett of Arkansas and Steve Spurrier of Florida. Steve Spurrier won the Heisman Trophy his senior year and was later inducted in the College Football Hall of Fame both as a player and as a coach. I managed to escape my football years with only minor physical injuries but thanks to Steve Spurrier I did leave with some mental scars. My Junior year we were scheduled to play Florida mid-season but Hurricane Hilda blew through Baton Rouge that weekend and the game was postponed to the end of the season. By then we had one of the top defenses in the country and had gone through the regular season without giving up a passing touchdown. (That statistic would not be possible today, and it was rather unlikely back then.) Unfortunately, that night against Spurrier we gave up two. The first one was over me and it was witnessed by 65,000 fans. It was a play that I replayed in my sleep over and over again but could never change the outcome. Building a Research Program from Scratch   The first step in building my research program at UT was establishing a real-time process control laboratory. My PhD dissertation research had been conducted entirely with computer simulations. It seemed important that my research at UT include at least some applications where a computer was actually connected to and controlling a real process. It wasn   t a straightforward objective. This was before the age of mini-computers and we did not know much about computers and very little if anything about computing in    real-time.    The first chore was selecting a computer system. With help from a new generation of computer vendors we selected a DEC PDP-18 with magnetic tape memory, D A and A D converters. All programming was done in machine language through a teletype interface. The teletype was the first piece of computer equipment delivered. It set in a room all by itself for a couple of weeks connected only to a paper tape punch reader. One day I noticed there was an undergraduate student busy working with the teletype. I walked up to see he had rigged the paper tape reader punch to continually and loudly print the following message   Dr. Moore Sucks! Dr. Moore Sucks! Dr. Moore Sucks!...  I   m not sure what that says about my relationship with students at that time but we had a good laugh. The computer arrived soon after and the teletype and computer were put to a better use. By the way this was the first computer system on campus that was not part of the central computer center. There was considerable institutional resistance to departmental units having our own computer systems. And at the time a new system-level Vice President was named to approve all departmental computer purchases. His annual salary could have funded several computers similar to ours. Smaller Computers and Bigger Applications   After establishing the process control lab facilities, we did a lot of work using even smaller computers. Computers on a chip (i.e. PDP-8, PDP-11) became readily available. Through research contracts we developed a number of industrial control systems. Our application focus was on large industrial HVAC systems. We selected applications that could benefit from advanced control algorithms but did not have the payback that could justify costly industrial computer-based control systems. Short Course Visibility   Early in my career I was fortunate to have the opportunity to help teach short courses for the AIChE. Process Control was a relatively new focus in chemical engineering and there was no shortage of practicing engineers who wanted to know what it was all about. Initially I teamed up with Paul Murrill and Cecil Smith (my professors from LSU) with a series of short courses that included basic as well as advanced topics in process modeling and control. During the first five or six years of my career these workshops were offered at nearly every national AIChE meeting. This exposure provided me ongoing contact with engineers in industry who were looking for help in solving real control problems. In return, these problems help me define my research agenda and provided examples to use in class discussions. (For example, students have always enjoyed my discussions of helping Proctor and Gamble develop the controls system for the Pringle potato chip machine). Throughout my career I continued to consult and teach workshops both in the US and in Europe. By the way, I was in Madrid, Spain teaching one of these workshops when 911 happened. Ron Rousseau (Georgia Tech), Jim Downs (Eastman Chemical Co), and I were presenting a workshop on Distillation Design, Operation, and Control when the world as we knew it changed. We would stay several extra days before we could complete the workshop and find a flight home. Measurement and Control Engineering Center   Early in my career I helped organize the Measurement and Control Engineering Center (MCEC) and served as co-technical director for almost 20 years. MCEC was a consortium of member companies interested in basic research in a variety of topics related to controlling industrial processes. Research projects were selected and funded by the member companies with some additional support for the National Science Foundation. The program provided support for some graduate students and faculty in three departments in the college- chemical, electrical, and nuclear. MCEC also had collaborative research contracts with other similar university-based consortiums (i.e. Lehigh University, University of Washington, and Oklahoma State University). I am fortunate that my academic career spanned a period in history in which practical engineering research was permitted and industrial sponsorship was encouraged. My academic career would not be possible today with the current emphasis on basic research funded by large government grants. Applied Control Concepts, Inc.     I am thankful that my position at the university allowed me to pursue, within limits, outside opportunities. In addition to workshops and short courses, I also was able to serve as part-time consult for those companies that needed more than a workshop. Once I even formed a small company (Applied Control Concepts, Inc.) to allow us to design and manufacture some microprocessor-based control system that one of our sponsors needed. These connections outside of the university helped keep my academic focus relevant. Process Control Internship   In 1980 a relationship with Eastman Chemical Company was established that would be the highlight of my career at UT. It was an honors class intended to provide a few students with a real experience in process analysis and control. Each year the class (CBE 467) would work on a problem provided by Eastman   s Advanced Control Technology group. Typically, the problem was one that was active and under review and study at Eastman. At the beginning of the semester Eastman would share the details of a problem.     With signed security agreements we were given drawings, historical data, and tours, as well as lengthy discussions about the effect of the problem on plant-wide operations.   The students under my direction worked on the problem all semester, and usually a little bit more before presenting our results to Eastman. This program was active for more than 37 years. It gave a group of students an example of something much bigger than problems found in textbooks. For me it became the center of my ongoing education. Every year I was presented with a new set of intellectual challenges. The solutions were never straightforward and had to be developed. I learned something from every study that was made and I frequently was able to carry that understanding back to my research program. I am grateful to Eastman   s Advance Control Technology Group for sponsoring this unique program. Also, I deeply appreciate the plant areas within Eastman that agreed to let a group of students and their professor have unusual access to plant operations. It was a unique educational experience for me and for the students. I think it was also a unique experience for the group of unusually talented engineers to participate in the education of the next generation of engineers. A special thanks must also go to Jim Downs, the leader of the Advanced Control Technology Group. Jim   s knowledge of chemical engineering is only surpassed by his enthusiasm for problem solving. His enthusiasm is both inspiring and contagious. Engineering vs Statistical Process Control   Near the middle of my career I became aware that there were two very different and competing understandings of the meaning of process control. In the chemical industry process control was about using engineering controllers to make frequent but subtle adjustments to keep the process in control. In discrete manufacturing the philosophy was to operate in such a way that adjustments were seldom necessary. Frequent adjustments only meant that the process was not in control. In the mid-80s some vendor supplier contracts required the implementation of SPC control charts in the chemical industry. When and where to use SPC vs EPC became a confusing issue and one that intrigued me. For a number of years, I worked with my industrial sponsors and with the College of Business to help more clearly define the role of each and how best to integrate the two strategies. 50 Years- Then and Now   It was interesting to me to note that two popular campus icons, the torchbearer statue in Circle Park and the    Rock    on Volunteer Boulevard, arrived on campus about the same time I did. Fifty years ago, engineering students still used slide rulers and engineering faculty wore coats and ties to the classroom.   There was only one digital computer on campus. Class sizes were much smaller, but we taught multiple sections and had Saturday morning classes. Dougherty was a relatively new building back then but is now beginning to show it s age. Renovations to the undergraduate labs have helped, plus it is surrounded by newer more modern engineering and science facilities. Change happens in jolts and jerks   For me, personally the biggest change is that I was much younger 50 years ago. I started teaching when I was 25 and at that time I was younger than most of the graduate students. The first PhD committee I served on was a young man who started his graduate program when I was still in high school. Change is not timeless. It happens in jolts and jerks. I remember when it first dawned on me that students who use to be my age were suddenly the age of my children. I still clearly remember the first student that said    Dr. Moore, my father had you when he was in school.    And yes, I did have at least one student who admitted that I taught her grandfather. It all happens so quickly. Another echo across time is the realization that many of my former students are ahead of me in retirement. One example stands out. About 20 years ago our family physician retired and was replaced by a new physician named Alan Rice. When we were introduced, he looked me in the eye and said with a smile,    You teach at UT, don   t you?    Then he reminded me that he was in the first class that I taught at UT. He graduated and worked as a chemical engineer for a few years then went to med school. I am thankful to now have him as my family physician. As I approach the age where medical issues happen more and more frequently it is extremely helpful to have a doctor that can talk to me about medicine using chemical engineering analogies. Timeless Distillation   Throughout my career, it has occurred to me the important role that distillation plays in chemical engineering education. I am not talking about the columns as much as I am not talking about attracting and collecting students interested and capable of working as a chemical engineer. And, the fact that the students we attract are generally bright, self-confident, thoughtful, and caring compared to their general age group. And, above all else our students are curious about learning how things work. One of the most rewarding aspects of my career is that for the past 50 years the average age of most of the people I am around on a daily basis has always been in their early 20s. While in school they are forever young. Eventually most move on to graduation and to life in the real world but I expect they will always fondly remember their timeless days as a UT student. I feel privileged to have shared some of those days. I cherish our time together. As for my many wonderful graduate students, I thank you for the tender care you have all taken with my continuing education. I appreciate you checking in on me every so often and gently correcting my understanding of the difference between engineering education and engineering practice.","link":"http:\/\/cbe.utk.edu\/the-foundation\/"},{"title":"Dylan Chitwood Keeps Time with Engineering","content":"Dylan Chitwood Keeps Time with Engineering Dylan Chitwood grew up in the quiet rural town of Winfield in Scott County, Tennessee. Anyone looking for him there might have followed the sound of his clarinet, an instrument he picked up in fifth grade. He still plays, but dual enrollment courses in high school sparked his interest in chemical engineering.    It seemed like the best way to combine my interests of math, chemistry, and biology,    he explained. The musical chemical combo ignited impressive time-management skills as well. The Chancellor   s Honors senior now maintains a rhythm of duties as a member of Ferguson Faculty Fellow in Chemical Engineering Cong Trinh   s ViPaRe research group, as an Engineering Student Ambassador, and as assistant drum major for UT   s Pride of the Southland Band.        As the ADM, I am responsible for knowing everything that head drum major Rebecca Percy does from week to week. We play between nearly every single play and coordinating that takes two people. I am also responsible for leading the White Pep Band in the Vol Walk before every game as well as directing the Volleyball Pep Band.       Dylan Chitwood Chitwood also fills a role during band rehearsals as a    Blacksuit,    responsible for teaching the marching drill and other Pride traditions to incoming freshmen.    I am very excited for the opportunity to act as a teacher,    he said. This Volunteer spirit echoes in his academic and research priorities. For his biomolecular engineering thesis, Chitwood examined recently discovered anti-CRISPR proteins as a potential mechanism for the delivery of antimicrobial drugs.    I really want to make an impact in the medical community by developing pharmaceuticals,    he said. His thesis investigation is akin to the medicine-delivery research of Trinh   s group project.    The ViPaRe project is a big undertaking,    he said.    I never thought I would have the chance to work on a project funded by DARPA, especially as an undergrad.    Chitwood looks to advance these efforts as he weighs potential futures in academia or industry, and he intends to provide his own soundtrack along the way.    I hope to continue playing in ensembles at my graduate institution or in a local community band,    Chitwood said.    Music has brought me many great experiences, opportunities, and friends over the last eleven years and I couldn   t imagine just giving it up.

I always knew I was interested in medicine and in bio-research,    said Alshibli.    I considered biomedical engineering for a while, but I liked how the classes in chemical and biomolecular engineering let you look at and solve issues at a much smaller scale.    Specifically, she took an interest in learning about the possibilities related to regenerative medicine and stem cell research and how breakthroughs in those areas could lead to specifically-tailored treatment, something she called the    caretaking component.    One early research opportunity that fueled her imagination came through the International Genetically Engineered Machine  (iGEM) competition. IGEM brings together teams of students from around the world with a common goal of using genetic engineering to solve a problem or contribute to the greater good. As a member of UT   s 2016 team, Alshibli and her fellow students used E. coli bacteria to convert byproducts of petroleum processing such as benzene into useful products such as fragrances and flavorings. In that way, the team was able to take substances that would have been otherwise harmful to humans and considered waste products into harmless and purposeful materials.    One of the requirements of iGEM is that you can   t just focus on the research  you also have to demonstrate how it would impact society and undertake outreach efforts,    said Alshibli.    It was a lot of fun, and it helped each member of the team learn to play to their strengths for the overall good of the project.    She pointed out that biomolecular research has led to other uses of it as well, including as a source of manufactured insulin. Her next step is to begin medical school this fall, further highlighting the work of the department and how it impacts humanity. Alshibli already has some experience in a medical setting, having served at a regenerative healthcare center in Edinburgh, one of two summer undergraduate study abroad trips in Scotland. Taking advantage of such opportunities is something she would encourage current and future students to do, but with a caveat.    Don   t be afraid to try new things, but remember to tell yourself that it   s OK to stop if the excitement wears off,    said Alshibli.    If you go to the first meeting of a group or attend an event, it doesn   t mean that you   re bound to go to the rest. You only have so much time as a student. Use it wisely.    With medical school, a bright future, and a path of her choosing ahead of her, it   s clear she   s done just that.  highlight color= fountain   Five Questions  Amany Alshibli For Amany Alshibli, the question wasn   t so much whether she   d come to UT after high school, but rather what she   d study once here. Her father, Khalid, is the associate department head of graduate studies and professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, and her older sister, Noor, is also a UT grad. She won several accolades during her time at UT   including being named a Torchbearer in 2018, the university   s top honor. Question  When did you know you wanted to be an engineer? Alshibli  I knew a lot of good things about the college, so it just made sense to come here. Before that first year was out, I realized how awesome my choice had been and some of the amazing things that were possible. Q  What are some of the experiences that shaped your time here? A  Like many, I took engineering fundamentals as a freshman, opting for the program   s honors path. That experience was tough, but cool and was the perfect gateway to the rest of my time in engineering. Q  How did the freshman program serve that role? A  It helped me transition into college life and also helped me make a lot of friends with whom I   m still connected. Q  Do any faculty members stand out for the way they shaped your experience within the department? A  Associate Professor Eric Boder was a major influence during my time in the department. He focuses on engineering proteins, immunology, and molecular biology, and was able to help me see potential career paths through the innovative nature of his classes. Q  What, in particular, stood out about his classes? A  His classes allowed us to merge technology and science. Being able to connect those two was exciting. It really piqued my interest.   highlight ","link":"http:\/\/cbe.utk.edu\/chance-to-have-personal-impact-drove-alshibli-to-success\/"},{"title":"A Message From the Department Head 2018","content":"A Message From the Department Head 2018 The Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, continues to make dramatic strides in national leadership in chemical engineering education and research. I don   t like to focus on rankings, but for the first time ever, we have moved in to the top 40 of public university chemical engineering programs, achieving 39th in the U.S. News and World Report 2019 rankings. Evidently, our hard work over the past ten years is paying off with higher national visibility, ultimately greatly benefiting our students and alumni network. Speaking of students, with approximately 65 full-time PhD students and 425 undergraduate students, we have the largest student body in the history of the department. Furthermore, with 19 instructional and research faculty, we have the largest number of educators housed within the department since the 1980s. Our research profile continues to ascend, with expenditures and publications likewise rising. In spring of 2018, we added two new members to our Hall of Fame. Joining Professor John Prados   our inaugural inductee in 2016   and subsequent inductees Michael T. Harris and James B. Porter Jr., are two alumni who have been employed at Eastman Chemical Company for over 70 years combined  Mark Cox ( 89, BS) and Stephen Crawford ( 87, BS). We are very grateful to have such esteemed alumni in executive management positions at a company that is internationally recognized for its leadership and innovation in the chemical industry. Professor Emeritus Charlie Moore was inducted into  Control  magazine   s Process Automation Hall of Fame, and Gibson Chair Stephen Paddison was appointed as a fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry. Furthermore, UT-ORNL Governor   s Chair for Biorefining Art Ragauskas received AIChE   s 2017 Professional Achievement Award for innovations in green process engineering. Our faculty continue to achieve research milestones and garner major national awards. Each of our last four assistant professor hires has won a prestigious NSF CAREER Award during the past two years, bringing our total number of faculty members to have achieved this award to six. Also, our UT-ORNL Governor   s Chair for Electrical Energy Conversion and Storage Tom Zawodzinski   s project, Reversible Fuel Cells for Long-Duration Storage, was chosen by the US Department of Energy as one of 10 recipients of  Advanced Research Projects Agency   Energy grants. Lastly and most importantly, our outstanding body of students has also been recognized for their hard work and dedication. Senior Amany Alshibli was recognized for her academic achievement, leadership, and outstanding service with the highest student honor   the Torchbearer award. This is the second CBE student recipient in less than five years. Senior Christopher Neal was selected as a 2018   2019 Fulbright alternative for a study and research grant to Germany. Undergraduates Michele Christy, Katherine Krouse, Andy Skipper, and Alshibli, were awarded the Extraordinary Academic Achievement citation. The Chancellor   s Citation for Extraordinary Professional Promise was awarded to undergraduate students Jared Clements, Alshibli, and Neal, as well as doctoral students Nelly Cantillo Cuello, David DeSimone, and Brian Mendoza. A record number nine CBE students achieved chancellor   s citations, tops among all UT academic departments. I am sincerely grateful to all our alumni, private donors, and corporate sponsors, especially Eastman Chemical Company, who have continuously supported CBE over the past ten years, thereby enabling us to have achieved the tremendous growth I mentioned above. We feel truly honored to have such a talented, generous, and dedicated group of supporters. With your help, we have now begun to be recognized for the superior education and research that our department excels at. Thank you for your support.
