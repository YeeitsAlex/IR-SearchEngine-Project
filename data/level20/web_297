                  December 13, 2013—Take a look at the breadth of religious life at Harvard, where members of the community participate in moments of worship, spirituality, and community across the University. Students can engage in prayer or reflection in one of Harvard’s historic places of worship or in one of many less formal locations—a dorm room, dining hall, office, or Widener Library.

Since 1983, we have celebrated the gift of LGBTQ lives and all that they add to the rich tapestry of the congregation's life together, honoring the gifts of LGBTQ people in every facet of church life. 


As a progressive, inclusive congregation, we seek to answer God's call to hold fast to love and justice for the earth and all its people. Through our common life of prayer, worship, spiritual formation, and the arts, we strive to follow the example of Jesus and to work, through active nonviolence, for social, racial, LGBTQ, economic and ecological justice, and for peace.



On Sunday mornings at OCBC, we join for services of worship that include music by instrumentalists and the OCBC choir, thought-provoking sermons, and shared community prayers. We celebrate Communion on the first Sunday of each month. 



Our Sunday worship services begin at 10:30 a.m. We are located at 1151 Massachusetts Avenue and 400 Harvard Street (our building spans the block) in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  The church building is just five blocks from the Harvard Street T-Station. Free parking is available for the duration of the service.">

                 <a class="" href="https://chaplains.harvard.edu/chaplaincies/sikh-community" title="Sikh Life and Practice in Boston
Many of Boston's earliest Sikhs were professionals—doctors or engineers, for instance—who arrived in Boston in the years after the adoption of the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act. A second wave of Sikh immigration occurred in the aftermath of the deadly riots in Delhi in 1984, bringing Sikhs of a wider range of occupations and backgrounds to the area.
Keeping with tradition, the Punjabi language is used during Sikh&amp;nbsp;divans&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(services) for scriptural recitation and&amp;nbsp;kirtan &amp;nbsp;(sacred music), but several&amp;nbsp;gurdwarasin the area provide translations with a projector. Punjabi classes are also common, particularly for younger worshippers and second-generation immigrants.
Kirtan&amp;nbsp;is an integral part of Sikh observances, and in addition to the traveling musicians that perform the scriptural hymns, some Boston&amp;nbsp;gurdwaras&amp;nbsp;provide&amp;nbsp;kirtan&amp;nbsp;lessons for interested youth, and children often play the instruments and sing during the&amp;nbsp;diwan. The langar, or communal meal, is another important aspect of Sikh culture, and worshippers and guests alike are invited to share an Indian meal at the end of the weekly diwan.
Particularly after the events of September 11, 2001, common misunderstandings about Sikh culture and customs—especially the turban—have led to incidents of discrimination across the United States, and Boston has been no exception. On September 12, 2001, for instance, a member of the Milford Gurdwara Sahib was arrested on an Amtrak train for carrying a&amp;nbsp;kirpan, a small knife customarily worn by Sikh men. While the charges were eventually dropped, the incident left many of Boston's Sikhs shaken, concerned, and motivated to engage with the broader Boston community to ensure that such confusion could be reduced. Some Sikh groups, for instance, created initiatives to teach law enforcement officers about Sikh practices and customs. Many&amp;nbsp;gurdwaras&amp;nbsp;have also held public events such as&amp;nbsp;chhabeel&amp;nbsp;celebrations, which provide opportunities to explain Sikh beliefs and traditions.
