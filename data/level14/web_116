          We are glad to have Ravi Raman as this weeks guest speaker. Ravi will talk about “A Scalable Blockchain Approach for Trusted Computation and Verifiable Simulation in Multi-Party Collaborations” this Friday, Nov 9th 3pm at CSL369.
         </p>
         <p>
          Abstract: If you were to receive a trained machine learning model or simulation output that was purportedly created using computationally-expensive open source code based on data that was also open, would you trust it? If the peer you received it from was known to cut corners sometimes because of resource constraints, would you trust it? In the absence of fully re-running the computation yourself, which could be prohibitive, you might not. And without such trust, and any unquantified notion of “reputation”, collaboration would be out of the question. In this talk we will consider the problem of establishing reliable, distributed trust guarantees in large-scale computational systems, by designing a scalable blockchain framework for a peer-to-peer network, with focus on transparency, accountability, and scientific reproducibility in social good applications.
         </p>

          We are glad to host Prof. Madhow Upamanyu from UC Santa Barbara as guest speaker. At this week’s social hour, Prof. Upamanyu will talk about “ECE is Critical when Software Meets the Physical World” which is reflection of his personal experience in transitioning cutting edge signal processing ideas from the university into Uber. Please join us this Friday, Oct. 12th at 3pm in CSL369.
         </p>
         <p>
          Abstract: Companies such as Google, Facebook and Uber have scaled their footprint in the world through their expertise in deploying large-scale software. As this software interacts with the physical world, tightly integrating ECE expertise, especially in modeling and signal processing, is critical to success and safety. I will speculate on how one might overcome the cultural barriers in achieving such integration, after discussing my personal experience in transitioning cutting edge signal processing ideas from the university into Uber.

          We are glad to have Prof. Huang as social hour guest speaker this Friday, Sept 14th at 3:00PM in 369 CSL, In this week’s social hour Dr. Huang will talk about “Fast Parallel Programming with Complex Task Dependencies using Modern C++”.
         </p>
         <p>
          Abstract: Parallel programming is a key component in high-performance software. However, it is difficult to write a correct parallel program especially under complex task dependencies. In this talk, I am going to introduce Cpp-Taskflow – an open-source C++17 library to help you quickly write parallel programs with task dependency constraints. According to out user, “Cpp-Taskflow has the cleanest tasking API he has ever seen.” I believe you will be able to master Cpp-Taskflow within 5 min and use it right away to boost your research project.
         </p>

          Bio: Dr. Huang is a Research Assistant Professor at CSL and ECE. His research focus on software systems and design automation. He won the 1st Place in ACM SIGDA CADathlon International Programming Contest (Olympic Game in EDA) and the 2nd Place in ACM Student Research Competition Grand Final (ACM Award Banquet). He also received the Graduate Award and Graduate Fellowship from the UIUC ECE department.

          Join the Social Hour to learn about the people of the administrative infrastructure with whom CSL students, postdocs and faculty interact with and get emails from, and about the CSL place CSL members will spend many hours during the upcoming academic year. And most importantly come, and enjoy food and company of CSL peers, staff and faculty.

           Charbel Sakr
          </strong>
          as social hour guest speaker this
          <strong>
           Friday, April 13th at 3:00PM in 369 CSL
          </strong>
          , In this week’s social hour Charbel will talk about “
          <strong>
           Reduced Precision Machine Learning
          </strong>
          “.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Abstract
          </strong>
          : Machine learning models such as deep neural networks are starting to achieve human level accuracy in many cognitive tasks. However, such successes often overshadow the tremendous complexity of typical deep learning models. In this talk, we focus on numerical precision – a key parameter defining the complexity of neural networks.

           Bio: Charbel Sakr
          </strong>
          is a graduate student working in CSL with Professor
          <strong>
           Naresh Shanbhag
          </strong>
          . Charbel obtained his Engineering degree from the American University of Beirut in 2015 graduating with High Distinction. He then joined the University of Illinois where he is now a PhD candidate in the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. His research interests are in resource-constrained machine learning, with a focus on analysis and implementation of reduced precision algorithms and models. Charbel is also interested in fun facts and coincidences. For instance, he takes great joy in knowing that, should he ever have his own lab, its acronym would be CSL.
