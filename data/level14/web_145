       Brigham Young University (“BYU”) websites may provide links to third party websites that have their
                    own terms of use, privacy policies, and security practices. The inclusion of any third party links
                    is for convenience and general information purposes only and does not imply a recommendation or
                    endorse the views expressed within them. Further, neither BYU nor The Church of Jesus Christ of
                    Latter-day Saints has any control over the nature, content, or availability of these third party
                    sites.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I acknowledge that although I may use my BYU account to access third party sites, neither BYU nor
                    The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (1) endorses any third party website nor the content
                    of such websites that I can access through my BYU account, and (2) makes any representations or
                    warranties of any kind, express or implied, about the completeness, accuracy, reliability,
                    suitability or availability with respect to any third party website or the information, products,
                    services, or related graphics contained on such website for any purpose.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I will maintain the privacy of my login credentials, including BYU Net ID and password, and take
                    full responsibility for anything done with my BYU Account.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I will not attempt to circumvent information protection schemes or uncover security vulnerabilities.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I will not deliberately perform an act that may seriously impact the operation of university systems
                    and resources.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I will not deliberately perform acts that compromise or monopolize resources to the exclusion of
                    others.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I will not engage in activities that do not comply with state or federal law, the Church Educational
                    System Honor Code, or with the standards of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
                    Saints.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I will not falsely communicate with others, use an unauthorized assumed identity, or imply a
                    representation of Brigham Young University unless the message is sent within the course and scope of
                    employment or as an official of BYU.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I will adhere to University Policy, including the
       <a href="https://policy.byu.edu/view/index.php?p=32">
        Computer and Electronic Communications General
                    Use Policy
