             <p>
              The function of the State Climatologist is to collect, disseminate, and interpret climate data. This  web 
			site provides links to sources of climate data and seasonal forecasts for the state of Washington. Most data 
			on the site are available for free; a charge may apply for additional data or interpretation, or for testimony 
			in a legal case.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Office of Washington State Climatologist (OWSC) is called by the State of Washington to serve as a credible 
			and expert source of climate and weather information for state and local decision makers and agencies working on 
			drought, flooding, climate change, and other related issues. When interpreting climate information or analysis, 
			OWSC will rely foremost on peer-reviewed literature and on best practices, sometimes consulting with other experts 
			as needed, and is willing to revise public statements in light of solid new analysis or information.
			Our on-going goal is to provide information to the public that is reliable and meets the highest quality standards.
             </p>
             <p>
              Links to our most popular utilities can be found at the bottom of this page. A complete list, as well as links to 
			quality outside data sources, can be found in the Climate Data tab.
