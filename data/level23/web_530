       Evening Care Overview
      </h3>
      <p>
       The WSU Children’s Center Evening Care program offers a safe and welcoming environment with a flexible schedule for Infants, Toddlers, Preschool and School Age (to age 12). Children’s activities include art, music, science, cooking and choice centers for play and learning. Outdoor play areas and large motor activity areas provide for children to exercise and engage in play with peers. Dinner and snack are provided each night and are based on the USDA meal standards. Children participate in age grouped classrooms and engage in developmentally appropriate activities. The school age program also offers homework support for children. If you have any questions, please call us at 509-335-8847.
