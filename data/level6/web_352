     <h2>
      Welcome to the UCSF web directory!
     </h2>
     <p>
      You can use this site to find contact information for people and departments affiliated with UCSF. To search
            for people use the “Search for people” tab.  For departmental information, click on the “Search for
            departments” tab. Once on the desired search tab, enter your search term into the input field above the
            blue button and then click the button. All searching, whether for people or departmental information,
            is case-insensitive.
     </p>
     <h2 id="help-people">
      Searching For People
     </h2>
     <p>
      When searching for people your search term applies to people information and department names. This flexibility
            enables you to use a partial or whole department name to find all the members of a given department. Note
            that searching for a department name within the “Search for people” tab does not provide department
            information, only people information as related to the department(s) found. In general, the longer your
            search term is, the narrower your results will be.
     </p>
     <p>
      When your search returns multiple results you will receive a list of abbreviated records. Click on a person’s
            name to see their individual record. Click on a person’s department name to find all people within that
            department. Clicking on a person’s email address will cause your browser to launch your computer's default email program
            to compose a message to the given email address. When your search returns a single result, the result list
            will be bypassed and you will receive a single individual's record. The links mentioned above
            behave the same when viewing an individual record.
     </p>
     <p>
      To search for a person by name you may use all or part of his or her name. For example, to find a person
            named John Smith, you might use one of these searches:
      <ul>
       <li>
        john smith
       </li>
       <li>
        j smith
       </li>
       <li>
        john s
       </li>
       <li>
        smith, john
       </li>
      </ul>
     </p>
     <p>
      Note that searching for Joe will not currently find people named Joseph because "joseph" does not begin with
            "joe." It will, however, find people named Joel or Joey.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Be specific.
      </strong>
      There are many people named Jen at UCSF, so to find the one you're looking for,
            you might try including a last initial or a department name. For some very general searches, especially for
            large departments, this directory may not even display all of the results. In that case, you will see a
            message explaining the situation and asking you to try a more specific search.
     </p>
     <h2 class="edit-btn" id="help-update">
      How To Update Your Entry
     </h2>
     <p class="edit-btn">
      On the far right of the tab bar (where you choose the people or department search tabs)
            there is an “Edit My Record” button.  Clicking on this will allow you to log in, via MyAccess, to the the
            self-service section of the directory website. After logging in you will be presented with the edit page for
            your own directory entry. From there you will be able to edit your entire directory entry except for your last
            name, title, department and email address.
     </p>
     <p>
      Those with a campus address may choose from a
            large selection of preformed campus addresses. Private practice address information must be initially entered by Human Resources, your
            departments’s Payroll/Personell Analyst or Business Officer.
     </p>
     <h2 id="help-departments">
      Searching For Departments
     </h2>
     <p>
      Your search term(s) will match departments by department name. While searching by department within the
            people search tab returns information regarding people related to the given department, searching by
            department within the department search tab yields departmental information. The results
            will contain physical addresses, website address, phone numbers, fax numbers and other department location
            and contact information.
     </p>
     <p>
      To search for a department, first be sure you have selected the Search for departments tab. Then use all or
            part of the name of the department. For example, searching for cardio would return departments with names
            like Cardiology, Cardiovascular, Cardiothoracic, etc.
