As such, our faculty are a central driver of the university   s academic accomplishments and the greatest contributor to all aspects of the university   s missions of instruction, research, and service to society. The college   s twenty-one academic departments and schools, eight centers and institutes, and  thirteen interdisciplinary programs span the disciplines of the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and the visual and performing arts. The college is also home to the Language and World Business Program and the College Scholars Program. There are 640 fulltime-equivalent (FTE) instructional faculty in the college which includes 420 research- active tenure-track faculty and 219 non-tenure track faculty. Instructional Impact of the College of Arts and Sciences The College of Arts and Sciences is the gateway to knowledge for every undergraduate student who enrolls at UT. As part of the university   s general education curriculum, all students receive core instruction from the college in the humanities, the visual and performing arts, and the social and natural sciences. Thus, our faculty provide significant teaching support for undergraduates from across the university, delivering nearly three-quarters of the student credit hours of all lower division courses and about one-third of the student credit hours required for typical four-year degrees in business, engineering, and nursing. In addition to providing instruction for the university-wide general education curriculum, our faculty provide instruction within the college to nearly 7,000 undergraduates seeking degrees in the college   s 141 undergraduate majors, concentrations, and honors programs. They also provide opportunities for about 1,300 graduate students to seek degrees from fifty different graduate programs and certificates. In total, the instructional faculty in the College of Arts and Sciences provide an impressive fifty-one percent of all student credit hours university-wide. On average over the past five years (2008-2014), the college has granted 1900 bachelor   s degrees annually and just over 300 graduate degrees annually (combining master   s and doctoral degrees.)

Faculty awards for academic outreach will be presented by the dean at the annual Faculty Awards Dinner. Purpose The Academic Outreach Awards recognize extraordinary contributions of faculty to the public that occur as an outgrowth of academic pursuits and are related to the university   s academic mission. The faculty awards are based on demonstrated outstanding contributions to the public stemming from their academic expertise. Academic Outreach Academic outreach is defined as integrated scholarship which engages the institution   s academic missions of research, creativity, teaching, and service with the community at large. It involves the university   s faculty and students employing their academic expertise to engage the community in reciprocal, collaborative relationships to improve the quality of life for citizens. In turn, the relationships with the community inform the scholarship and learning of faculty and students and supports university initiatives designed to enhance diversity and intercultural awareness. Academic outreach cuts across the institutional mission  therefore, faculty may be nominated for excellence in academic outreach through outreach teaching (including courses with a service learning component), outreach research and creative activity, or outreach service. Outreach teaching extends the university   s instructional capacity to provide learning opportunities to public audiences through workshops, public lectures, educational presentations to P-12 teachers and students, designing developing educational exhibits, and other educational activities. Such teaching might employ innovative uses of information technologies to make university resources accessible to those at a distance through on-line courses or the design of educational websites. Faculty may also perform outreach teaching by extending their classroom beyond the campus to engage their students in service learning. Through service learning, faculty design their course to enable their students to relate the academic content of their coursework to the real world by providing a needed service to the community as they apply and test their learning. Both service learning and student voluntary community service involve student engagement with the community  however, service learning differs from community service in that service learning experiences occur in the context of courses which are part of the approved curriculum and involve faculty and their students in a thoughtfully designed learning experience with defined learning and experiential goals as part of the course requirements. Outreach research and creative activity involves extending faculty research and creative endeavors to serve the public at large. This goal may be accomplished through a variety of research activities  basic discovery research, applied or action research, original performances, and creative applied policy. Outreach research is often seen as an externally focused activity that brings together faculty and community collaborators to address real world problems and issues. Such collaboration, however, is only one of the ways in which outreach research can take place. Basic research and creative activity may also develop into outreach research, for their results may eventually be transmitted to an external audience or it may open a line of inquiry that benefits the public. Indeed, the best examples of outreach research and creative activities are those that engage faculty in advancing knowledge through the pursuit of their scholarly interests while simultaneously addressing community problems and issues, thereby benefiting the scholar, the discipline, the university, and society. Outreach service entails employing faculty knowledge and professional expertise to serve society through application of expertise in direct service, consultation with public, private, and civic institutions of all kinds, and other activities which apply faculty knowledge to the benefit of the community. Through outreach service, the intellectual resources of the university   s faculty are applied to helping seek solutions to community problems and issues. As faculty knowledge provides insights which inform citizens of choices, provide needed services, and inform public decisions, faculty enhance the quality of life of the citizens in the communities served by the university. Outreach service does not include  institutional service (e.g., service on university committees), professional service (e.g., service to various professional and learned societies), or community   service (e.g., charitable service outside the faculty member   s academic expertise). Rather, outreach service is defined more specifically as extending to the community faculty   s disciplinary expertise acquired through research, scholarship, and creative activity. Eligibility All full-time tenured and tenure track faculty of the College of Arts and Sciences are eligible forthis award. Adjunct faculty, instructors, and graduate teaching assistants are ineligible. Previous award recipients are ineligible for five years following their receipt of the award. The awards are intended to honor faculty who have exceeded normal expectations in their academic outreach activities and whose work has addressed a real community need through academic outreach. Nominations of Faculty Nominations will be solicited from department heads or directors. A nomination form is attached. The letter of nomination should be limited to two typed, double-spaced pages. The letter should indicate whether the nominee is being nominated for outreach teaching, outreach research and creative activity or outreach service and should address the nature and quality of the academic outreach performed by the nominated individual and why it represents an extraordinary accomplishment that exceeds normal expectations for faculty. A copy of the faculty member   s current curriculum vitae should be attached to the letter of nomination. Nominators are asked not to include additional materials because they will NOT be considered. Nominations should be submitted to  Dean Theresa Lee  no later than October 26 at 5 00 p.m. Recipients Year Recipient Department 2017 Karen Lloyd Julie Reed Henri Grissino-Mayer Microbiology History Geography 2016 Daniel Feller History 2015 Joe Miles Psychology 2014 B.

Eligibility These awards are available to Arts & Sciences full-time faculty members who are pre-tenure or who have received tenure, and who have spent at least two years at UT immediately preceding the nomination. We seek to recognize faculty members who excel in scholarship and creative activity while also being fully engaged in the other responsibilities of faculty jobs, primarily teaching and service (to the department, university, and profession). Individuals who have received a Convocation research award within the last five years may not be renominated for the same award. In 2014 a maximum of two awards will be made at each level except the Distinguished Senior level, where one award will be made. Early-Career Awards Full-time tenure-track or tenured faculty with at least two years on the UT tenure track immediately prior to the nomination, and no more than 8 years after the terminal degree are eligible for early career research awards. Midcareer Awards These individuals will be 8 to 15 years after the terminal degree, and who have spent at least two years at UT immediately prior to the nomination. Senior Awards These individuals will be at least 15 years after the terminal degree, and who have spent at least two years at UT immediately prior to the nomination.

The College of Arts and Sciences wishes to recognize the efforts of those who reach out beyond their departmental and disciplinary borders to explore new areas. Since fall 2012, at the annual Faculty Awards Dinner the college gives an award to a team that shows the potential to be particularly successful in interdisciplinary scholarship and research. Eligibility To be eligible for this award, collaborative groups must involve at least two departments in the College of Arts and Sciences, and preferably two divisions within the college (arts, humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences will be recognized as divisions for this award). Groups that have developed enough stability to be named as centers or ORUs would not normally be eligible. Because the chancellor gives an award for cross-college collaboration, such collaborations are not a priority for the Arts and Sciences award. Groups that wish to be considered should have moved beyond the idea stage. They should be able to show a tangible outcome of the collaboration, such as a coauthored published paper or national-level presentation, or the submission of a joint proposal to a nationally-competitive funding agency. Nominations should be in electronic format and include the following material  A completed Development of Interdepartmental Collaboration in Scholarship and Research Nomination Form A list of the faculty members involved, specifying the units to which they belong A letter (no more than two pages) that describes the nature and history of the collaboration Two-page CVs of the leading members of the collaboration Self-nominations will be considered.

The faculty in the College of Arts and Sciences provides the foundational instruction for these students, helping them to put down the roots that will nurture their lifelong learning. As the first public university and institution of higher education in the state of Tennessee, the tradition of the College of Arts and Sciences is deeply rooted in providing an education that develops broad intellectual capacities instead of focusing on specific technical skills. In the College of Arts and Sciences, we adhere to the basic philosophy to empower individuals with broad knowledge, transferable skills, and provide a strong sense of values, ethics, and civic engagement. In 1869, the University of Tennessee became a land-grant university, which broadened the institutional focus from a liberal arts college to include public agricultural and mechanical colleges. The foundation of a liberal arts education, however, was not lost in the reorganization. The addition of professional colleges, such as agriculture, law, and medicine, built the university   s reputation as a comprehensive academic institution while at the same time maintaining at its academic core a broad general education curriculum. As the flagship campus for the University of Tennessee system, we have the opportunity to educate Tennesseans from across the state. By providing undergraduate students with access to new and diverse ways of problem solving, communicating, and interacting with each other, we can make an impact on the future of the state of Tennessee. About the College The College of Arts and Sciences is the oldest college at the University of Tennessee. In 1794, Blount College opened its doors to offer a broad education in the arts and sciences and became one of the first colleges established in the state of Tennessee. For more than 100 years, Blount College (renamed University of Tennessee in 1879) remained one institution until President Brown Ayres reorganized it into different colleges with independent academic units. By 1913, each academic unit had its own dean and the separation of responsibilities laid the groundwork for what would become the comprehensive academic institution of the University of Tennessee. The College of Liberal Arts, however, continued to function as the academic core of the university, providing both discipline specialization in sciences and the humanities and general education for students in engineering, agriculture, law, medicine, and dentistry. In 1994, it was renamed the College of Arts and Sciences. Today, it remains the gateway of knowledge for every undergraduate student enrolled at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. With 21 academic units and schools, eight centers and institutes, and 12 interdisciplinary programs that span the disciplines of the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and the visual and performing arts, the College of Arts and Sciences remains the largest, most comprehensive and most diverse of the 11 colleges and the central driver of academic accomplishments at UT. Over 8,000 undergraduate students have an academic home in one of the college   s 141 undergraduate majors, minors, concentrations, honors and pre-professional programs. The college also offers more than 50 graduate programs to a population of 1,300 graduate students. More than 600 faculty in the College of Arts and Sciences provide instruction for 53 percent of all student credit hours across the university. Of those, 420 are fulltime, tenure-track, research-active faculty. Values Our college is guided by adherence to core values that define the Volunteer spirt and permeate who we are, what we do, and our approach to living and learning at UT and beyond. As a college, we seek to promote the values of free, bold, and ethical intellectual inquiry  vibrant and effective civic engagement  respect for diversity and cultural variety  and an understanding of and appreciation for our nation and world   s rich natural and cultural heritages. Vision We seek to excel among public research universities across the disciplines of humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and the visual and performing arts. We will provide the foundation for nurturing lifelong learning and engagement in our graduates. We will attract and sustain faculty who pursue path-breaking research and creative expression that enriches lives and seeks solutions to society   s problems. We will promote diversity and inclusion in order to prepare our students to be innovative citizen leaders on a global stage. The vision of the college contributes to that of the university by providing research and teaching excellence, providing students with opportunities to apply what they learn by working with highly productive and respected faculty on campus and in community outreach locally and around the world. The faculty and students embrace and are committed to the volunteer difference as part of the goal to balance excellent education and research in a top public research and land grant university. Mission Our mission is to uphold the highest standards of academic freedom and integrity and to cultivate in our students the critical thinking skills, intellectual inquiry, and understanding of diverse human cultures that are necessary to become engaged global citizens. By emphasizing core values of life-long learning and adaptability, our academic programs provide students with the intellectual foundations for a rich, fulfilled, engaged life and career as an informed citizen. We seek to teach empathy and self-knowledge throughout our college. We will spread cultural and scientific literacy across the state of Tennessee and beyond. By doing so we serve all aspects of the university   s mission.

Valuing diversity means recognizing differences between people and acknowledging these differences are a valued asset. Valuing diversity means respecting individuality while promoting respect for others. Valuing diversity means emphasizing the contributions of the various groups that make up the population of the world. Valuing diversity means understanding the importance of people sharing their stories and learning from the stories of others. Valuing diversity is the right thing to do. We are committed to creating a vibrant multicultural, multi-ethnic community where diverse students, faculty, and staff are recruited and retained and where diversity scholarship is respected. We seek to develop graduates who can effectively work across differences and are prepared to live and work in a global society. We believe in creating a diverse student body because we believe this results in a deeper educational experience. Preparing students to become lifelong learners who can navigate in and contribute to a heterogeneous world after graduation should be a primary goal of education at UT. Diversity is an aspect of the world we should expect our students to explore, making it an asset they can use. We expect graduates to have completed a course of study that will enable them to see differences among people as a powerful tool for solving problems and seeking opportunities. We expect graduates to embrace diversity as a source of lifelong learning, personal fulfillment, and creative possibility.

His work examines the impact of substance abuse treatment on the prevalence and frequency of intimate partner violence and psychological aggression, as well as the effects of substance abuse treatment on other domains of relationship and family functioning. Dr. Stuart   s studies have shown that intimate partner violence perpetration and victimization are overrepresented in populations of individuals in treatment for substance abuse, and that substance abuse is overrepresented in men and women court mandated to attend batterer intervention programs. Other areas of research include examining whether including substance use treatments in batterer intervention programs improves outcomes for men and women arrested for domestic violence  as well as conducting treatment outcome research in general, and specifically for family violence and substance misuse. Nate Kelly, Associate Professor of Political Science Nathan joined the faculty of the University of Tennessee in 2005. He was previously an assistant professor at the University at Buffalo, SUNY. Nathan received his M.A. (2001) and Ph.D. (2004) from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and completed his undergraduate degree at Wheaton College (IL) with highest honors. His primary research interest is the macro political system of the United States, where he examines how different parts of the U.S. governing system (from Congress, to public opinion, to macro policy outputs) influence one another and respond to stimuli over time. He is also interested in political behavior and public opinion at the micro level. Finally, he conducts research in quantitative methodology that is motivated by problems encountered in his research agendas. For additional information about Dr. Kelly   s work, please visit his  personal webpage. Shih-Lung Shaw, Professor of Geography Shih-Lung Shaw   s research interests cover transportation geography, geographic information science (GIScience) and spatio-temporal analysis, especially with topics related to air transportation, effects of information and communications technologies (ICT) on human activity and travel patterns, transportation planning and modeling, time geography, space-time GIS, and GIS for transportation (GIS-T). Dr. Shaw is a Fellow of the American Association for Advancement of Science (AAAS) and a recipient of the Edward L. Ullman Award for outstanding contributions to the field of transportation geography of the Association of American Geographers (AAG). Sergey Gavrilets, Distinguished Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Depending on the context, I call myself a theoretical evolutionary biologist (most of the time) or an applied mathematician (sometimes). I use mathematical models to study complex evolutionary processes. Over the last several years, my research interests have mostly concentrated on the following major areas  social and cultural evolution, speciation and adaptive radiation, sexual conflict, holey fitness landscapes, and micro-evolutionary processes and macro-evolutionary patterns. I have also studied mathematical models aiming to describe explain the maintenance of genetic variation in natural populations, dynamics of genetic variation under selection, frequency-dependent selection and coevolution, maternal and parental effects, hybrid zones and clines, and spatially heterogeneous selection. For additional information on my work, please visit my  personal web page. James McNulty, Associate Professor of Psychology My program of research focuses on how strong beliefs may change or remain stable over time. For the most part, I have addressed this issue in the context of close relationships, where initially positive beliefs frequently become negative, despite partners    strong motives to maintain them. This transformation raises the possibility that there may be limits to social psychological theories that suggest people possess effective techniques for maintaining their desired beliefs. My long-term research goals are to understand and define these limits and, in doing so, to suggest directions for promoting the resilience of initially satisfying beliefs about close relationships. Issues I am currently investigating expectations, forgiveness, cognitive structure, physical attractiveness, psychological and physical abuse, and sexual satisfaction. E.J. Coffman, Assistant Professor of Philosophy My research and teaching revolve around four interrelated topics  The nature of  luck, and its bearing   for better or worse (or both)   on the nature and scope of human knowledge and free, morally responsible action. The epistemic requirements on free, morally responsible action (   What must you know   or at least  believe, justifiedly or otherwise   to freely do things for which you deserve moral credit or criticism?   ). Two important connected questions about the nature of knowledge  (1) Can whatever it is that    fills the gap    between mere true belief and knowledge be had by false beliefs as well as true ones? (2) Are the conditions for your knowing something in any way sensitive to how important it is to you that the thing in question turn out to be true? The nature of, and relations between, epistemically permissible (proper, justified) belief and assertion  the bearing this issue has on a central debate about the semantics of knowledge-ascribing and -denying sentences  and the bearing of that semantic issue on the nature of knowledge itself.

Financial management is comprised of three related components  budgeting, financial accounting and reporting, and recordkeeping. Department heads must work closely with the Budget Director in preparing, monitoring, and adjusting the department   s budgets.   Although budgeting is a continuous process throughout the year, there are several important periods of formal and specific focus on the budget.   These include the following  revised budget in October, budget planning meetings in late fall or early spring semester, projected annual expenditures in March, budget preparation (input into IRIS) in April, and close of the fiscal year in July. Unlike some other colleges on the UT campus, the accounting for the college   s constituent departments is not centralized  personnel in each department perform accounting within the unit.

Exceptions to the number of times a course may be repeated will be allowed only with prior written permission from the head of the department where the course is being offered and the student   s college dean or designee. Grade Replacement Policy for Three Lower Division (100-200 Level) Courses The first three lower-division (100-200 level) course grades may be replaced when a course is repeated. All other grades will be included in computing the cumulative grade point average. If the same course is repeated more than once, the additional repeat(s) will count toward the grade replacement total.

Meeting with a pre-law advisor is a great way to ensure you are on the right path as you move through your next couple of years as an undergraduate student. Ensuring you maintain very good grades is of upmost importance during your first couple of years. You need to also look for ways to become connected to the University, either through service, leadership in an organization, or volunteer work. Take a minute to look at first year and second year resources for ways to become involved at UT. As you transition from your second year to your junior year, you will want to begin collecting information on the various law schools in the United States and start looking at different regions of the country where you would like to live.   Further, you will want to work on developing faculty relationships. These faculty members will become very important to you as they will eventually serve as recommenders evaluators for you when you begin the application process.   You will also need to begin preparing for the LSAT exam. During your senior year, you will begin the law school application process. Applying to law school takes an enormous amount of time and dedication, so you need to be sure that law school is the right graduate path for you. Below are some suggestions on how to best organize your time during this process beginning with your junior year. Be sure to invest in a daily planner so you can stay organized during the application process. You will need to keep track of schools you have applied to and or plan to apply to, materials you have sent to LSAC and independently to individual Law Schools, and application deadlines. Junior Year  accordion   toggle title= Fall   Start establishing rapport with faculty. Just remember, you will need some really strong evaluations or letters of recommendation from faculty members, and they need to know who you are to best evaluate you or write you a good letter. Try to gain some experience in the field  look at internship possibilities. Begin researching schools using the  Official Guide to ABA-Approved Law Schools  (pre-law advisors in Advising Services can assist you in you researching specific law schools).  The Official Guide to US Law Schools  is also a good source of information. Start preparing for the June LSAT. Try taking practice tests from start to finish, and be sure to time yourself. Also,  Kaplan  offers free testing events in fall and spring, so sign up for one of these free test dates. You can also check out  LSAC website for LSAT practice materials.   toggle   toggle title= Spring   Register for the June LSAT. If you haven   t begun study, then register for the October LSAT.

Think about your personal statement. Brainstorm ideas and develop your essay from there. See the  Personal Statement  link on this website for ideas. Register for Law School Credential Assembly Service (CAS). Send your transcripts to CAS. Start researching law schools. Sign up for the Candidate Referral Service (CRS) on the LSAC.

Outstanding letters of recommendation can be a huge role in the admissions process.   Please visit the LSAC section for evaluations recommendations for additional information. Asking for recommendation letters can often be an intimidating process. You must choose who to ask, gather information such as your resume and academic transcripts to assist that person in writing a good evaluation or letter of recommendation, and actually ask him or her to write exactly that, a good recommendation letter. You are applying to law school, so you must take an active role in this process. Be responsible, apply yourself, and take advantage of this opportunity to really get to know faculty in your department and network. Keep these suggestions in mind when looking for excellent recommendations  Pick the Right People You would probably be surprised by the number of applicants who choose their references by title or prestige. Think about this  having a mildly encouraging letter from someone who barely knows you (or who only knows you based on the information you provide) can actually harm you in the admissions process.   Instead, ask someone who you have worked with regularly. Professors (or supervising employers if you   ve been out of school for a while) will generally write the most authentic letters. A good idea is to enroll in a couple of courses taught by the same professor and or visit with that professor during office hours. The professor can get to know you beyond you being a number in his her class. Ask for a Great Recommendation Think about this  if you ask for a recommendation, you are going to get  a recommendation. You need to ask for a great recommendation. The faculty member who writes about you will be more likely to put some thought into the task and contribute relevant information about you in the letter. Give Your Writers Plenty of Time If you ask for a letter of recommendation close to a deadline, you not only risk missing that deadline, but you could also compromise the quality of your letter because your recommender will be pressed for time. You should give your writers at least four weeks notice and inform them of upcoming deadlines. Provide Information that Will Help Them Write About You   A faculty member who has your resume will be able to write a more persuasive letter for you. When someone accepts your request to write a recommendation, think about having some or all of the following information available  A cover letter that lists deadlines, requirements, and relevant instructions Forms that must accompany the recommendation A copy of your r  sum   and or a description of your experience with the faculty member employer to refresh his or her memory Copies of your transcripts A statement addressing why you want to pursue a legal education and outlining your career goals You can include pre-addressed, stamped envelopes for each letter, including an extra for yourself (if the person is willing to let you review the letter sent). However, some recommenders will want to send your letter on their own letter head and college addressed envelope, so be sure to check with that person first to see what they would prefer. Your contact information should your recommender have questions Don   t forget that as the applying law student, there is information the LSAC will need from you to complete your recommendation file. Visit the  Law School Admissions Council   s Website  if you have any questions. Evaluation Services An evaluation rates both cognitive and noncognitive attributes and skills that have been identified as important to successful lawyering, using a scale that represents degrees of a particular characteristic.   An evaluation provides law school admission professionals information about your abilities above and beyond what is currently provided via test scores, transcripts, and letters of recommendation. The evaluation uses a rating scale that represents degrees of a particular characteristic. Evaluators can also include free-form text comments after each category as well as in the final comments section of the evaluation. Evaluations are completely electronic.","link":"https:\/\/artsci.utk.edu\/future-students\/pre-law\/lors-and-evaluation-services\/"},{"title":"Phi Alpha Delta Law Fraternity","content":"Phi Alpha Delta Law Fraternity Phi Alpha Delta Pre-Law Fraternity is a pre-professional coed fraternity for undergraduate students of any major interested in attending law school.

The reality is that lawyers seek in analyzing a case is not always well defined. Legal study, therefore, requires an attentive mind and a tolerance for ambiguity    ABA  LSAC Official Guide to ABA Approved Law Schools, Chap. 2, page 7.   pullquote  Law schools consider many factors as they evaluate a potential candidate  course selection, entire academic record, grade point average, writing skills, LSAT scores, personal statements, and recommendation letters.  As a student thinking about law school, you should consider taking courses that will enhance your intellectual skills and provide you the opportunity to strengthen and enhance the following skills  Analysis and Synthesis Reading and Listening Comprehension Writing in a Concise Manner Critical thinking All of these skills will assist you in developing the abilities necessary to learn how to decipher information in a more deliberate manner. If you have the time and inclination, adding a minor in a heavy writing or reading comprehension area, such as English, history, or philosophy, can be a good idea. Why Should You Develop These Skills as an Undergraduate? A law professor will rarely explain precisely what the rule of law is in a particular case or area, often because it is impossible to do so. Instead, you are expected to develop and organize your own understanding of the shape and trend in precedent as you digest hundreds of appellate cases. Your classes, as well as examinations (which are in essay form and usually offered once in each course at the end of a semester), will require extensive reading and preparation. Therefore, accomplishment will most certainly depend far more upon skill at rapid analysis and articulation than upon memory and regurgitation. What can you do? Prepare for rigorous academic work. Maintain a balance in your academic experiences. Explore a variety of subjects. Further develop your communication and analytical skills. What should you ask yourself when deciding on a major? What  am I interested in studying? What majors will I enjoy? Will I be successful in  the courses required  by this major? Will this major be a good choice for me if I decided not to attend law school? Law schools do not dictate what you should major in. The best major or specialized course of study for you is the one in which you are most interested. In addition, achieving good grades is incredibly important for admission to law school. With that in mind, you will likely do best in a field that you enjoy. Mastery in a specific subject is a useful experience, so even though your choice of major will not give you an    edge    in admissions decisions, the design of your overall undergraduate academic experience is very important. The most valuable piece of advice your pre-law advisor can offer you is to work hard and get the best education you can. Also, be sure to take the first couple of classes in a potential major to ensure it   s the right one for you. You might want to consider a minor or double major if you have several interests.","link":"https:\/\/artsci.utk.edu\/future-students\/pre-law\/what-should-i-major-in\/"},{"title":"The Personal Statement","content":"The Personal Statement The process of developing a Personal Statement is a unique endeavor. Each student needs to properly evaluate the required components provided by the law school to which he she is applying and follow each instruction exactly as written. Personal Statements should match the requirements of that law school. You will want to visit the Writing Center for assistance with your personal statement. If you are having trouble getting started, you will find some great tips for creating a great personal statement on this page! You should think of the Personal Statement as an interview with the law school. This may be the only opportunity the law school admissions official has to learn about you as a complete candidate. That being said, you need to consider what you should include when constructing your statement. Foremost, what is it you wish the reader to know about you? Remember, no part of the application is taken on its own merit. A personal statement is sometimes the only part of your application where you can provide substance and details about yourself. It is your chance to talk about who are. If done well, it will provide insight into how well you know yourself, how you think, what you value, how you write, how well-rounded you are or have become over time, and what you have been able to learn from the experience of living. Below are some suggestions to consider when formalizing your personal statement  Interview Always consider this a professional, yet informal interview with the law school. Tailor the response to the exact guidelines of each school. Read requirements carefully and follow directions. Think about ways in which the person reading your statement can learn more about you. You want this person to care about you when considering your application. Create a personality around which the remainder of your application will be viewed. Time, Process, Structure Devote the time necessary to writing your statement. Include an introduction, body, or detailed supporting paragraphs, and conclusion. Be sure to edit, edit, edit! Read your statement aloud both to yourself and to another person. Work with others to evaluate your statement. Take your statement to the University   s Writing Center or to the pre-law advisor. Answer the question(s) asked, and follow directions precisely. Be concise but brief (within two pages if at all possible because Law School admissions officers will be reading hundreds, in some cases thousands, of these statements). Unless otherwise specified, use reasonable margins, font size and length. (1    margins, 10   12 font size, and single spacing legible to the normal eye) Topic and Content Read and follow all directions included in the application from the individual schools. Discuss the unique nature of your  experience. life experiences could include a special talent, skill, or athletic endeavor. personal experiences could include career ambitions or diversity of life experience. Talk about the unique nature of  who you are  for the many reasons that have developed created these characteristics. A particular life experience that has created an interest in law. Incorporate that which was exceptional, worthwhile, and activities that mattered. Discuss what makes you a special candidate. Explain grade trends in an addendum, not here, unless it is relevant and critical to your statement. Do not include information that is found in another part of the application (resume, transcript, application form). Include leadership, student government, community service again  only  if these are pertinent to the statement (these should appear on your resume). Personal Qualities Discuss your passion, sincerity, depth, authenticity, perseverance, and character. Be thoughtful. Determination vs.    I   m a hard worker.    Discuss your personal growth. Remember include personalized information that can support both strengths and weaknesses without being arrogant or defensive. Some Don   ts      I   ve always wanted to go to law school since I was three.      Carelessness   Careless errors and language.      I   d give my left arm.

College criteria for faculty promotion and tenure are varied and complex. They recognize that each faculty position has its own distinctive requirements and that the missions of academic units within the college are highly diverse. Moreover, advancement in academic rank and or the award of tenure must be based on a faculty member   s demonstrated proficiency in fulfilling his her particular role and in contributing to the performance of the unit mission. Beyond these specific considerations, the college expects all faculty members to make significant contributions in three general areas of academic life  (a) teaching and corollary activities  (b) research, scholarship, and creative accomplishment  and (c) service to the college, university, public, and profession. It is recognized that individual contributions may not be equal in these three areas. Accordingly, more limited achievement in one area may be offset by unusual excellence in the other two areas. Any such differentiation among the three dimensions of faculty participation must be consistent with the commitment of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, to a distinctive research mission. Successful faculty members will share that commitment. A clear record of continuing accomplishment and potential in this area is, therefore, absolutely necessary for positive promotion and tenure consideration. It is the view of the college that the excitement and inspiration of active research and creative accomplishment are essential to sustained enthusiasm for teaching and effectiveness in the classroom. Recognizing the critical importance of the teaching mission in higher education, the college seeks excellence of instruction not only as a goal but also as a demonstrated fact. Systematic documentation of teaching quality and effective results is expected of all faculty under consideration for promotion and or tenure. Finally, it is assumed that all members of the faculty will contribute to nonteaching service in their departments, the college and the university, as well as to their professions and the public. They will be expected to provide documentation of such service at the time of promotion and or tenure consideration. More specific criteria by academic rank may be summarized as follows  Professor 1. Should hold the doctorate or other terminal degree in the discipline, or possess outstanding experience and expertise appropriate to the particular appointment  2. should normally have served as an associate professor for at least five years  3. should have acquired an established national professional reputation demonstrated through a record of research, scholarship, or creative accomplishment, indicative of continuous and progressive professional development since faculty appointment in the university  4. should have achieved a demonstrated record as an accomplished teacher in his her field  and 5. should have contributed significantly and substantially in some combination to meeting the needs of the University, the community, and the profession. Service expectations are greater for full professors than for individuals holding lesser ranks. Associate Professor 1. Should hold the doctorate or other terminal degree in the discipline, or possess outstanding experience and expertise appropriate to the particular appointment  2. should normally have served as an assistant professor for at least four years  3. should have a strong record of research, scholarship, or creative accomplishment with clear promise that promotion to professor is likely at some point in the future. Appropriate evidence would be publication of a book-length manuscript or comparable contributions to the profession  and 4. should show evidence of excellence in teaching, including one or more evaluations by peer visitation of classes prior to consideration of promotion to associate professor. Assistant Professor 1. Should hold the doctorate or other terminal degree in the discipline, or possess outstanding experience and expertise appropriate to the particular appointment  2. should have established an active research creative achievement program with the goal of publishing a book-length manuscript or equivalent research contributions, or making comparable contributions to creative achievement by the time of consideration for promotion and tenure  3. should demonstrate strong interest in teaching and clear promise of classroom excellence in performance  and 4. should participate significantly in professional activity in the discipline beyond formal teaching and research.

Since all letters of appointment for tenure-track assistant professors establish a seven-year probationary period with tenure consideration    not later than    the end of the sixth year of the probationary period, this policy applies to any assistant professor standing for tenure before the sixth year. It also applies to any individual standing for promotion to full professor before the fifth year after promotion to associate rank. This document establishes a protocol that brings the College into compliance with university policy and insures uniformity in the approval process for early consideration cases. This document does not establish criteria for early consideration. It is assumed that each case will be judged according to its particular merits. University policy statements governing early consideration are as follows     Faculty hired on the tenure track as assistant professors will be granted the full probationary period of seven years with tenure consideration in the sixth year. (The wording in the offer letter states that we will consider the person    no later than year X    with X = 6th year.) Faculty hired on the tenure track at other ranks who have not previously earned tenure will receive the same probationary period.    In cases of extraordinary accomplishment, individuals will be able to present themselves for tenure consideration prior to the sixth year with the approval of the department head and after the head   s consultation with the tenured faculty of the unit and with the dean. Only faculty demonstrating outstanding achievement in expectations for rank will be recommended for early consideration.    S. Martin,    Guidelines for Early Tenure Consideration,    February 14, 2007.    A tenure-track faculty member with an extraordinary record of accomplishment may request to be reviewed early for tenure and promotion. This request must be approved by the department head, dean, and chief academic officer.    Manual for Faculty Evaluation, 3.B.1.b    If the recommendation for tenure comes earlier or later than that specified in the faculty member   s letter of appointment (or for promotion after fewer than the normal number of years in rank), approval for early review shall have been requested and granted by the department head, dean, and chief academic officer. A copy of the approval must be attached to the summary sheet.    Emphasis added. Manual for Faculty Evaluation, Appendix B, A.1 Protocol Timing  Units are encouraged to begin discussion of    early consideration    of tenure at the retention review in the fall semester of the year prior to the anticipated P&T review. Under normal circumstances, the department   s request for approval of early consideration for both P&T and promotion only should arrive in the College office no later than May 30 of the year in which the review is to begin. Although the college will consider requests received after this date, department heads and directors are reminded that the approval process should be completed before they solicit external letters. Process  Department head director recommends early tenure consideration to tenured faculty. Tenured faculty meet to discuss recommendation and signify approval disapproval.1 Department head director sends written recommendation and candidate   s CV to the college. Dean reviews request. Only approved requests will be sent to the provost for final approval. Upon approval by the provost, a written record will be attached to the summary sheet of the dossier, in accordance with the policy stated above. Rev. 3 15 2012 1If tenured faculty members vote to approve early consideration, the vote shall not be construed as a positive vote for tenure promotion or a promise of a positive vote. Such a vote means only that the tenured members in the department are willing to recommend early consideration to the head   director, dean, and provost.","link":"https:\/\/artsci.utk.edu\/faculty-staff-resources\/policy-procedures\/promotion-tenure\/early-consideration-protocol\/"},{"title":"Academic Advising Terms","content":"Academic Advising Terms ACADEMIC HISTORY  An unofficial record of a student   s attempted coursework from all institutions attended.

As the primary health care professionals for the eye, optometrists examine, diagnose, treat, and manage diseases, injuries, and disorders of the visual system, the eye, and associated structures, as well as identifying related systemic conditions affecting the eye.   They also prescribe medications, low vision rehabilitation, vision therapy, spectacle lenses, and contact lenses, and perform certain surgical procedures. Additionally, optometrists detect and diagnose eye diseases and disorders including glaucoma, cataracts, and diabetic retinopathy. In all fifty states, optometrists are licensed to prescribe medications to treat ocular diseases. Optometrists are experts in determining one   s refractive error and prescribing the appropriate correction. Optometrists also counsel their patients regarding surgical and non-surgical options that meet their visual needs related to their occupations, avocations, and lifestyles. Like all health care professionals, optometrists refer patients to other practitioners when needed. Referrals are often made to other doctors if signs of diseases like diabetes or hypertension are seen in the eye, or to ophthalmologists for cataract surgery or LASIK. Prior to admittance into optometry school, students generally complete four years of undergraduate study. After receiving a Bachelor of Science degree, they go on to optometry school, which consists of four years of post-graduate, doctoral level study focusing on the eye, vision, and associated systemic diseases. In the United States, optometrists receive the Doctor of Optometry degree (OD) upon completion of optometry school. Optometrists must pass a rigorous national examination administered by the National Board of Examiners in Optometry (NBEO). The three-part exam includes basic science, clinical science, and patient care.   Some optometrists go on to complete residencies with advanced training in a specific sub-specialty. These specialties can include pediatric care, children   s vision, geriatric care, pre- and post-surgery care, specialty contact lens (for keratoconus patients or other corneal dystrophies) and many others. All optometrists are required to participate in ongoing continuing education courses to stay current on the latest standards of care. The scope of practice for optometrists is regulated by state laws and has some overlap with that of ophthalmologists.

This early work ensures that those classes necessary for a sound performance on the MCAT are completed before or during the spring semester of your junior year. If you plan to attend medical school the fall following your UT graduation, you should plan to take the MCAT by the late spring of your junior year or the summer following your junior year. Which classes you take and the sequence in which you approach them are very important. Your long term academic planning should be discussed with a pre-health advisor who can assist you in individualizing the schedule for your given area of study. You should review the course description in the undergraduate catalog (catalog.utk.edu) of any course you are considering to determine what prerequisites, if any, exist for the course. Freshmen should be particularly aware that Chemistry 120 has a prerequisite of Math 119 (College Algebra) or an ACT Math score of 25. Physics 221 has a prerequisite of Math 130 or any calculus course. An academic advisor can help you select the math course or sequence that best fits your academic plans.

While the work of a dentist is often surgical in nature, dentists treat many diseases of the oral cavity and face using prescribed medicines. As a dental student, you will be qualified to practice dentistry after graduating with the degree of Doctor of Dental Surgery (DDS). Training to become a qualified dentist in the United States typically requires eight years of study, including an undergraduate degree (often in the sciences) and four years of dental training. You will spend the last two years of dental training working directly with patients in the educational setting. General dentistry is the only non-specialty field of dentistry. General dentists typically do not focus their clinical practice on any particular discipline within dentistry  they may, however, further their training in one or more specialty areas such as surgery, endodontics, or orthodontics. Most general practitioners perform restorative, prosthetic, routine endodontic therapy, routine periodontal therapy, and simple exodontia, as well as regular examinations. Others are comfortable treating more complex cases such as dental implants and third molar extractions.

Chiropractic care is used most often to treat neuromusculoskeletal complaints, including but not limited to, back pain, neck pain,  pain in the joints of the arms or legs, and headaches. Doctors of Chiropractic, often referred to as chiropractors or chiropractic physicians, practice a drug-free,  hands-on  approach to health care that includes patient examination, diagnosis, and treatment. Chiropractors have broad diagnostic skills and are also trained to recommend therapeutic and rehabilitative exercises as well as to provide nutritional, dietary, and lifestyle counseling. The most common therapeutic procedure performed by doctors of chiropractic is known as    spinal manipulation,    also called    chiropractic adjustment.      The purpose of manipulation is to restore joint mobility by manually applying a controlled force into joints that have become hypomobile, or restricted in their movement, as a result of a tissue injury. Tissue injury can be caused by a single traumatic event, such as improper lifting of a heavy object, or through repetitive stresses, such as sitting in an awkward position with poor spinal posture for an extended period of time. In either case, injured tissues undergo physical and chemical changes that can cause inflammation, pain, and diminished function for the sufferer. Manipulation, or adjustment of the affected joint and tissues, restores mobility, thereby alleviating pain and muscle tightness, and allowing tissues to heal. Chiropractic adjustment rarely causes discomfort. However, patients may sometimes experience mild soreness or aching following treatment (as with some forms of exercise) that usually resolves within twelve to forty-eight hours. In many cases, such as lower back pain, chiropractic care may be the primary method of treatment. When other medical conditions exist, chiropractic care may complement or support medical treatment by relieving the musculoskeletal aspects associated with the condition. Doctors of chiropractic may assess patients through clinical examination, laboratory testing, diagnostic imaging, and other diagnostic interventions to determine when chiropractic treatment is appropriate or when it is not appropriate. Chiropractors will readily refer patients to the appropriate health care provider when chiropractic care is not suitable for the patient   s condition, or the condition warrants co-management in conjunction with other members of the health care team.

In general, the college will contribute to cost sharing. We must have a discussion with the PI and the department whenever cost sharing is a component of the budget. The earlier this topic is raised, the better. Ideally, cost sharing should be discussed while the budget is being developed. A cost share request that is for less than the amount of F&A to be retained by the college is likely to be approved. Cost sharing requiring larger contributions from the college will need detailed discussion and negotiation. For more information, visit research.utk.edu funding cost-sharing-on-external-proposals. Accumulation of Vacation Pay All twelve-month employees, including twelve-month faculty, postdocs, technicians, and staff accrue vacation and sick leave, which are charged to the grant. If the grant ends and the employees have not taken the leave to which they are entitled, it does not go away, and will have to be paid at some point. In such cases departments may be hit with large and uncomfortable bills when employees who have accrued compensable time leave UT. PIs must ensure that employees who are on soft money charge their hours to vacation time when they are not working, and departments must keep an eye on this. The college does not have funds set aside to cover such costs. Limited Submissions When the National Science Foundation and other agencies allow a limited number of submissions per university, the Office of Research will announce an internal deadline for preproposals. For more information, visit research.utk.edu funding limited-submission-policy. Office of Research Workshops The Office of Research   s Professional Development Program offers training and educational workshops free of charge for faculty, staff, and graduate students who are responsible for or interested in the requirements for funded research. In FY 2011, the program conducted eighty-one workshops with approximately 1,000 attendees. To request a session in a specific area, please contact oretraining@utk.edu. For more information, visit research.utk.edu training-workshops. NEH Summer Stipend The National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) Summer Stipend is a competitive program to provide support for faculty members in the humanities to do scholarly work. For more information, visit www.neh.gov grants guidelines stipends. This is the only NEH program that has limited submissions. In years in which more than the number of individuals allowed by NEH wish to submit proposals, the College of Arts and Sciences holds an internal evaluation. The initial notification is sent out in May. Preproposals are due in August. If more proposals are submitted than the NEH allows, the associate dean for research will create a committee to evaluate the preproposals. This committee   s membership changes annually, but it usually includes heads from appropriate departments that did not submit preproposals, and previous holders of NEH awards. The committee makes its evaluations early enough to allow the successful proposers adequate time to prepare competitive full proposals. Those who wish to submit proposals are strongly encouraged to contact Alan Rutenberg for important information on the process.","link":"https:\/\/artsci.utk.edu\/research\/external-funding\/"},{"title":"Proposal Submission: TERA\/PAMS","content":"Proposal Submission  TERA PAMS The Tennessee Electronic Research Administration (TERA) is a web   based information system that supports research and sponsored programs. It includes the Proposal and Award Management System (PAMS), which is used to create, route, and approve proposals for sponsored research. View the following categories for details. For additional instructions, visit the Office of Research TERA webpage. Responsibilities It is the responsibility of the principal investigator (PI) to submit the proposal   including all sponsor forms, supplementary documents, and a draft of the narrative   with a budget in PAMS with sufficient time to get all approvals. It also is the responsibility of the PI to check regularly to see that the approval process is moving along. The PI needs to respond rapidly to queries about the budget and related topics such as personnel. Departments are responsible for approving the proposal and budget in a timely fashion and for making sure that what the PI wants to do with personnel titles and payment is appropriate. See below for more details. The college will review the proposal budget and send queries to the PI if necessary. Budgets will not be approved unless they are clear and understandable. Deadlines The Office of Research requires five full business days for processing. Final proposal narratives are due to the Office of Sponsored Programs no later than 9 00 a.m., two full business date prior to submission. The college normally needs twenty-four additional hours, but proposals submitted close to the end of work on Friday may not be approved until Monday. Special requests for a more speedy review should be made in advance. Approval Process Departmental approval of a proposal means that someone with budgetary knowledge in the department has examined the budget and agrees that it is accurate. Please pay particular attention to the following factors  Correct statements of graduate student support and its implications for fringe and F&A. Whether the PI has departmental approval to be a PI. Cost-sharing provisions. These must be negotiated ahead of time and a correct account number must be provided. Whether the work has the on- or off-campus F&A rate. Whether additional space is required. Departments are responsible for negotiating for additional space ahead of submission. Cost-sharing needs to be negotiated by the PI well ahead of a proposal submission deadline, particularly if a large amount is involved. Requests for additional space should be handled within the department, except for proposals on the scale of centers. Departments should ideally have three individuals with the authority to approve proposals. Generally this would be the department head, associate head, and the exempt business manager. Secondary approvers should be alerted when the primary is unavailable. One member of the group must be available for approvals every working day, so that proposals don   t sit in departmental inboxes. When more than one department or college is involved in the approval process, the PI should set up the options in PAMS so that approvals at a given level can be simultaneous rather than sequential. That is, all departments should be listed as    #1,    and all colleges should be listed as    #2    to speed up the processing time. F&A for Proposals Submitted by Members of Centers & Institutes For FY16 and FY17, a plan has been implemented to provide some F&A to Centers and Institutes. The plan is described  HERE and the necessary forms are below  Request for Associated Status RIF Sharing Agreement ","link":"https:\/\/artsci.utk.edu\/research\/departments\/"},{"title":"SARIF","content":"SARIF Scholarly and Research Incentive Funds (SARIF) are selectively awarded by the Office of Research to cover the costs of faculty research programs, proposals, travel, equipment purchases, administrative fees, and other necessary resources.

In exceptional cases, such as the faculty member being invited to give a keynote address, the support will be up to $800. Faculty members who have other sources of funds, such as start-up funds or external grans or contracts, should use those fuds for travel rather than requesting college support.   This may need to be explained to the new faculty members whose start-up packages are not large enough to require an itemized budget. How to begin a foreign travel request and apply for reimbursement  Send your request via  e-mail to your department head.  Please include attachments regarding your trip such as registration and conference information, letters of support, etc.  Your request should include all the details of your trip, as well as a short budget.

The college and Thompson-Boling Arena are not responsible for valuables left unattended. Programs will be placed in students  seats prior to their arrival. Guests  guest tickets are not required for entry to the arena. Guests should enter the arena on the main concourse level where programs will be provided. Please note that concessions will not be available on the day of commencement.For information regarding accommodations for persons with disabilities or mobility concerns, please click here. Crossing the Stage Ushers will prompt students when to rise and move toward the stage. Make sure you take your seating card with you! As you approach the stage, you will give your seating card to the Reader of Names to receive recognition as you cross. Photography As a courtesy to all in attendance, guests will not be permitted on the arena floor for photography purposes. A professional photographer will photograph graduates as they shake the dean s hand on stage. A second photographer will take a professional studio shot once they exit the stage. If you have any questions regarding the professional photography (e.g., when you will receive proofs, how to order, pricing), please contact Grad Images at 800-628-4509, ext. 3581, or visit www.gradimages.com. Adjournment Immediately following their second photo, graduates will be directed to the graduate seating section where they will remain until the conclusion of the ceremony. Once the ceremony has been adjourned, students may meet their guests and depart from the arena. The ceremony will last approximately two and a half hours. Students Graduating with Honors The following information is taken from the Academic Policies and Procedures section of the Undergraduate Catalog. Honors are conferred upon graduating undergraduate students who have displayed a high level of achievement during their university career. Students graduating with honors must meet the following university criteria for conferral of honors  Recipients of honors receive their degrees with cum laude (3.50 through 3.64), magna cum laude (3.65 through 3.79), and summa cum laude (3.80 through 4.00). Grade point averages are not  rounded up  to achieve honors status. IMPORTANT! These honors categories are based on a student s cumulative average at the end of the semester preceding the graduation semester (Fall 2018)   not this semester! If you meet these requirements and are a spring graduate, your name will be listed with the appropriate honors category in the spring commencement program regardless of whether you attend the ceremony. If you meet these requirements and are a summer graduate, your name   but not your honors category   will be listed in the spring commencement program, since summer grades will not be submitted in time for us to know your  cumulative average at the end of the semester preceding the graduation semester  (see university criteria #2). If you meet the requirements once summer semester grades have been submitted, or if you raise your GPA to meet the requirements by the end of summer session, your name will be listed with the appropriate honors category in the following fall commencement program, regardless of whether you attend the spring ceremony. Spring and summer graduates who meet the university s criteria for conferral of honors, and who participate in the spring ceremony, will receive a gold honor cord compliments of the college. Honor cords will be distributed at the same time as seating cards. Students will be able to pick up their seating card and honor cords at the tables set up in front of room 312 in Ayres Hall from 10 00 am until 5 00 pm on Thursday, April 25th, Friday, April 26th and Monday, April 29th. What if your GPA increases this semester? If, at graduation, your grade point average would allow a higher honors category than that determined at the end of the semester proceeding the graduation semester, the Office of the Registrar will correct the honors category noted on your diploma at no cost to you and will contact you if your diploma mailing will be delayed. The change in GPA does not affect a student s receiving an honor cord prior to or following the ceremony. Questions? Only those students whose names are submitted to the college by the Office of the Registrar as deserving honors will receive recognition. If you have a question about your cumulative GPA (as of Fall 2018), visit the One Stop Shop. They are legally unable to discuss such matters by phone or with anyone other than the student in question. Decorum Please remember that commencement is a formal academic ceremony, and appropriate decorum is expected of graduates and their guests. Banners, large signs, and decorated mortarboards that obstruct the view of other participants will not be permitted. Graduates will be asked to remain in their seats for the entire event, as those who exit the arena floor will unfortunately be unable to re-enter the graduates  seating section during the commencement ceremony. We hope that everyone attending will focus their attention on our graduates and their accomplishments.","link":"https:\/\/artsci.utk.edu\/current-students\/undergraduate-commencement\/ceremony-details\/"},{"title":"Undergraduate Commencement RSVP","content":"Undergraduate Commencement RSVP The College of Arts & Sciences  commencement ceremony will be held  Saturday, May 11 at 9 00 a.m.  in Thompson-Boling Assembly Center and Arena.

Students with documented learning disabilities must be reviewed by the Office of Disability Services to determine if a substitution is warranted. If Disability Services recommends a substitution, the student should be referred to Melissa M. Parker for appropriate course substitution. Sign language is not an option! Natural Science A and B  Transfer students who have two lab science courses (i.e., Geology LD, and Chemistry 120) may petition to use the courses for Natural Science A even though the courses are not a sequence or a package. UT freshman and sophomores (non-transfers) must complete a full sequence of a lab science. These students have ample opportunity to fulfill the requirement as stated. Social Science  Two departments must be represented. Humanities  1) Substitutions must be writing emphasis courses that can be documented with a syllabus or course description. BA students MUST have both a List A and List B course. Non US History  US History is not acceptable except in the case of an international student who has not had US History in high school. If a graduating student is unable to complete a sequence because the required course is not being offered, the student may petition to take two courses from different sequences.   The courses should be from different periods of History.   For example, History 241 matched with Africana Studies 236. Upper Level Distribution  1) Substitutions must be writing emphasis courses. 2) A request to waive the European restriction if Western Civilization or Medieval Studies has been taken will be approved if it is a graduating senior problem. 3) Substitutions will be considered for students who cannot schedule courses and are trying to graduate. Major Requirements Petitions concerning major requirements must have departmental approval prior to coming to Advising Services. Petitions received at the counter not having departmental approval will be logged into the database and then forwarded to the department. Petitions approved in the department regarding major requirements may not be delivered to Arts & Science Advising Service via the student.   Graduation Requirements 120 total hours required for a BS or BA degree is never waived! 42 upper division hours  Waiver of this rule is rarely granted, especially if the student has elective hours remaining to reach their 120 (or 124) hour total. 60 hours at a four-year college and is never waived. 60 hour Honors Residency is never waived. 30-hours of final credit at UT Knoxville   Requests are considered based on extenuating circumstances and only if the student has completed at least 30 hours at UT Knoxville (i.e., if the student is graduating and has been unable to schedule a class at UT and the course is available at Pellissippi State). The rule is waived for students who have studied abroad during their last 30 hours. NOTE  If a student is earning his or her last required hours at an institution other than UT Knoxville, the credit may not arrive at UT in time for graduation. The student will then be eligible to graduate during the term following the enrollment in the transfer institution. 2.0 graduation GPA is never waived.  C  in all courses counted toward the major may only be waived with the major department s approval. Most departments do not allow  D s to be petitioned to count in the major. A  C-  can only count in the major if it is approved by petition. General Guidelines Complete all information on the petition including advisor s signature. Note what catalog year is being used. This is critical since the substitution is entered into DARS by catalog year. Always request a course description for LD and UD courses. The description should be attached to the petition. If the course is a  special topics  course involving variable content, the syllabus will be required. First state the substitution or waiver request, then add other pertinent information and rationale. Example  Waive 1 hour of the upper division 42-hour rule.   Student is carrying 18 hours fall term and has completed all other requirements for graduation in December. Include other courses being used to complete the requirement. Example  Allow Biology LD, 4 semester hours, grade A, taken at Roane State Community College to count toward Natural Science Part A requirement. Student will complete the package with Biology 102. All quarter courses must be petitioned in order to be entered manually into DARS. Petitions do not alter the transcript. Transfer courses must be listed on the transcript before requesting a substitution or petition. Students requesting accommodations in the curriculum based on a documented learning disability should be referred to Melissa Parker. Include the full name of the course as written on the academic history when writing a petition. Important  Petitions that are not completed (missing the catalog year, major, concentration, etc.) cannot be keyed into DARS.

The printmaking program is ranked third nationally, behind the University of Wisconsin and Rhode Island School of Design. Their graduate program is ranked seventeenth nationally among public colleges and universities--tied at seventeenth with Indiana University, University of Arizona, University of California Berkeley, SUNY-Purchase, University of Illinois-Chicago, and University of Minnesota-Twin Cities. **These national rankings are from the 2012 US News & World Report   rankings of the Best Graduate Schools in the Arts (MFA in Studio Art). Two hundred and thirty programs are ranked. Program rankings occur every five years. Two of the most prestigious national recognitions for humanities scholars are the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) fellowships and stipends. Since 2004, UT ranks first nationally in the number of NEH summer stipends, tied with Northwestern University. Since 2004, UT ranks eighth nationally in the number of NEH fellowships, tied with the University of Chicago. The UT Humanities Center boosts the research, teaching, and outreach mission of UT. Having completed its second academic year in operation, the UTHC is a    lab    for scholars in nine departments  art, classics, English, history, modern foreign languages and literatures, music, philosophy, religious studies, and theatre. The center offers seminars to bring together scholars who create new connections in their fields and provides its fellows with time and space to bring their work to publication. The center sponsors outreach programs to the community including    Conversations and Cocktails      a series of lectures by UTHC fellows held off campus in partnership with selected Knoxville restaurants, and co-sponsorship of the Tennessee High School Ethics Bowl for high school students which promotes critical thinking and prepares high school students who participate to be active and engaged citizens. Founded just three years ago, the Neuroscience Network of East Tennessee (NeuroNET) is now a UT Research Center directed by Rebecca Prosser, professor of biochemistry and cellular & molecular biology in the college and involving twenty-five arts and sciences faculty from different departments in the college   as well as faculty from seven other UT colleges, and members from UT Medical Center in Knoxville (UTMCK), the UT Health Science Center in Memphis, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), and other community partners. NeuroNET members are engaged in cutting-edge interdisciplinary research in the burgeoning field of neuroscience, focusing on general cognitive development as well as aging and dementia, stress, addiction, anxiety disorder, and Post-Traumatic-Stress-Disorder (PTSD). One of the most exciting outcomes of NeuroNet was the creation of an undergraduate concentration in neuroscience housed in the Interdisciplinary Programs Major within the College of Arts and Sciences, which is chaired by Jim Hall, associate professor of biochemistry and cellular & molecular biology. The neuroscience concentration, which also has an honor   s option, currently enrolls about 125 undergraduates and is already producing graduates who are pursuing careers in the research, medicine, and health industries. The VolsTeach Program is one of the college   s    big impact    programs! A partnership between the College of Arts and Sciences and the College of Education, Health, and Human Sciences, the VolsTeach program is addressing a national workforce shortage for qualified graduates in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines   a shortage that undermines our state and national economy and threatens our national security. The program also addresses a state and national shortage of qualified secondary school teachers in STEM disciplines. VolsTeach targets undergraduate math, science, or engineering majors who are interested in expanding their professional skills and exploring a career in secondary teaching. Students can graduate in four years with a degree in math, science, or engineering, as well as obtain teacher licensure in their respective content areas. The program emphasizes early and ongoing community-school-based experiences. Graduates of the VolsTeach program are qualified for a teaching career immediately upon graduation. If at any point they decide not to teach in the classroom, VolsTeach graduates have a strong STEM background which qualifies them for many other careers in the workforce. The new Strong Hall, currently under construction on Cumberland Avenue, will have laboratory space for all introductory chemistry and biology courses and will serve as the new home for the departments of anthropology and earth & planetary sciences. The Kenneth and Blaire Mossman Building scheduled to be completed and open for classes in fall 2018 will provide state-of-the art instructional and research space for portions of several departments within the college including microbiology, biochemistry, cellular and molecular biology, and psychology. It will also feature a modern vivarium. Over eighty percent of the faculty in chemistry, physics, earth and planetary sciences, ecology and evolutionary biology, microbiology, and biochemistry and cellular & molecular biology have external research funding. These funds not only help make UT an R1 (research intensive) university that produces cutting edge research in the natural sciences, but the funds also support the research of graduate students and research experiences for undergraduates. The number of undergraduates taking courses with these departments has increased with the number of majors up by 34 percent in the last 5 years, and the number graduating from these departments has also increased by 28 percent. The Department of Theatre is one of only twelve LORT programs in the United States. These are theater programs that house a professional company, which allows students the opportunity to perform with seasoned professionals. Last year every play needed to add performances to accommodate the demand. Many of their MFA graduates are working and performing on stages across the country, on film and television. The School of Music, an all Steinway school, is housed in the Natalie L. Haslam Music Center   a new state-of-the art facility. The school is respected throughout the country for their superb facilities and excellent teachers. Their graduates of the Opera Program appear regularly in the top performance venues in New York and throughout Europe. The first forensic anthropology center in the country was founded at UT in the anthropology department by Professor Emeritus William Bass. Presently, the Forensic Anthropology Center is ably led by a nationally renowned forensic anthropologist, Professor Dawnie Steadman. She and her faculty colleagues continue to be involved in cutting-edge research while training graduate students in research, and law enforcement professionals in important data collection skills. The center affords many resources for students, researchers, and law enforcement agencies. The psychology department has two highly ranked programs   clinical psychology and counseling psychology. The department has recently relocated the Psychological Clinic to a new state-of-the-art clinic space in the center of Knoxville. The clinic is a training facility for graduate students in the clinical program and an important public service program in the community. A full range of mental health services is offered to students and the public in Knoxville and the East Tennessee area as part of the department   s public service mission. About eighty percent of their clients are from the community. Fees are determined by the client   s financial resources.

Faculty receiving awards were joined at the event by their nominators and significant others who shared in the celebration of the honorees    accomplishments. Diversity Leadership Awards Derek Alderman, Professor and Head, Department of Geography Derek Alderman, a cultural and historical geographer, has over 100 peer reviewed journal articles and chapters to his credit, many of which address race, racism, and diversity. Much of his work focuses on the rights of African Americans to claim the power to commemorate the past and shape cultural landscapes as part of a larger goal of social and spatial justice. He is co-founder of RESET (Race, Ethnicity, and Social Equity in Tourism), and is currently working with a team of five universities on a large National Science Foundation (NSF) funded project on race, slavery and plantation tourism. He is in demand as a speaker in communities struggling to commemorate and understand the life and legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. and fields frequent media requests for interviews and commentary on issues in the news. His work has appeared more than 180 times in local, regional, and national news outlets. Michelle Commander, Assistant Professor, Department of English Since joining the faculty at UT, Michelle Commander has been actively engaged with diversity concerns in her teaching, scholarship and service. In her courses she aims to    encourage her students to speak from their experiences and to discuss respectfully their beliefs with one another.    Enriched by a year as a Fulbright Lecturer in Ghana, Professor Commander   s first book, Afro-American Speculative Flights  Return, Imagined Africas, and the Black Fantastic, will soon be published by Duke University Press. A member the College of Arts and Sciences Diversity Committee, she organized last year an Africana Studies Film Series and co-organized a forum for encouraging discussion of the events in Ferguson, Missouri. Last summer she discussed Saidiya Hartman   s narrative of the African slave trade, Lose your Mother with a large gathering at Knox County Public Library. In all these activities, Michelle Commander is helping community members learn about and develop a respect for diversity. Advising Service Awards Jennifer Bolden, Assistant Professor, Department of Psychology Jennifer Bolden is honored for her role as a dedicated advisor and mentor to a diverse population of psychology majors. She stands out as an advisor in the college   s largest department both because of the meaningful relationships she develops with her assigned advisees and the evident impact she has on the students she mentors in her lab. Since fall 2012, she has supervised over twenty-five undergraduate research assistants, with many of them presenting at the annual EURECA conference as well national meetings such as the Annual Convention for the Association of Psychological Science and the Annual International Conference on ADHD.     Her commitment to the success of students from diverse backgrounds is demonstrated by her work with three undergraduates affiliated with federally funded TRIO programs.     With professor Bolden as their advisor and mentor, these students successfully developed and presented research locally and nationally, and several are currently enrolled in graduate programs. Michael Handelsman, Professor, Modern Foreign Languages and Literatures and Distinguished Professor of Humanities Michael Handelsman is recognized for his work with students majoring in Global Studies and Hispanic Studies as well as students seeking prestigious scholarships and fellowships through the Office of National Scholarships and Fellowships (ONSF). Typically, he averages 150 advising appointments a term, and he views each of them as a teaching opportunity to encourage students to invent themselves and see education as a life-long process of self-reflection. He continues to advise UT alumni who are not enrolled at other institutions and who need assistance with graduate school applications, scholarship opportunities, and internships with non-profit organizations as well as applications for Fulbright scholarships. In the words of his nominator,    Guided by his belief that the undergraduate experience should be transformative, and by his life-long championing of foreign language study as a hallmark of responsible citizenship, Michael Handelsman is our primary difference maker when it comes to helping students realize their potential.    Excellence in Research & Scholarly Work Excellence in Research   Creative Achievement Award Senior  Todd Freeberg, Professor and Associate Head, Department of Psychology Todd Freeberg is interested in vocal communication. His studies thus far have focused on bird species, using a combination of field and laboratory approaches. His research seeks to understand the development, function, and evolution of vocal signals and signaling. The primary research focus of his laboratory is to understand how the complexity of social groups influences the complexity of communicative signals individual group members use with one another. The work combines naturalistic observation study, controlled experiments, and bio-acoustical analyses to assess how group size and diversity of social relationships within groups affects vocal complexity of songbird species. He uses field and semi-natural aviary approaches in investigations of the development and function of vocal signals and signal diversity. A Fellow of the Association for Psychological Science, Professor Freeberg has presented several invited plenary and keynote lectures at international professional conferences. He recently received a four-year grant from the National Science Foundation. Robert Norrell, Professor and the Bernadotte Schmitt Chair of Excellence, Department of History Robert    Jeff    Norrell is a leading voice in the nation on the subject of American race relations and African-American history. This fall he is publishing three books. Most notable will be a biography, Alex Haley and the Books that Changed a Nation, which covers the rise to national celebrity and great literary influence of Haley. Norrell argues that Haley   s books changed the way Americans, black and white, understood the black experience. Norrell    s numerous scholarly recognitions include the Robert F. Kennedy Book Award for his study of the Civil Rights Movement in Tuskegee, Alabama. He was the Fulbright Distinguished Chair in American Studies at the University of Tuebingen, Germany. Jeff Norrell   s very impressive body of scholarship speaks to some of the most important, complex, and urgent questions our society faces. Through the award, we recognize his great contributions to the national conversation about race, and the recovery of African-American history. Midcareer  Shawn Campagna, Associate Professor, Department of Chemistry Shawn Campagna works at the interface of biology and chemistry.     He has pioneered the use of mass spectrometry for parallel analysis of complex mixtures of metabolytes which has applications in chemistry, microbiology, biochemistry, cellular biology, nutrition, and veterinary and agricultural sciences. Professor Campagna was the driving force for creation of the Biological and Small Molecular Mass Spectrometry Core (BSMMSC) Facility which he directs. His impact on the biological research community at UT has been most significant. In the last five years, he has led or contributed to proposals that have brought over $4M of funding to UT from the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation. Of that funding, $1.5M has been in direct support of his research. He has authored twenty-three publications in the past three years, including ones in two high impact journals   Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and the Journal of Microbial Ecology. Daniel Magilow, Associate Professor, Department of Modern Foreign Languages and Literatures Professor Magilow   s research focuses on several thematic strands within the interdisciplinary field of German Studies, including German-Jewish Studies and visual culture of 20th- and 21st-century Germany. The four books and ten articles and book chapters he has published qualify him, at early mid-career stage, as a respected expert in Holocaust Studies, one of the most established specializations in German-Jewish Studies, as well as in the emerging field of Visual Studies. In addition to his outstanding publication record, he has to his credit thirty conference presentations, thirteen photography exhibits, and a considerable record of grants, graduate student supervision, and national and international engagement. By way of context, a newly-tenured professor in German will normally have one book and three to six articles or book chapters. Magilow   s outstanding achievement as a researcher rests on his four books, extremely robust presentation profile, and numerous exhibits underscoring his mastery of both print and photography. Lois Presser, Professor and Associate Head, Department of Sociology Lois Presser is recognized internationally as one of the key figures in the emerging field of narrative criminology and the wider field of cultural sociology.   Her work is defined by innovation in both methods and theory, beginning with her earliest work on men   s tales of violence.   Switching from interviews to her recent narrative work,   Presser draws on literature and her expertise in discourse analysis, which involves systematic, deconstructive reading of texts, to weave together theories of harm.   In all her work, Presser asks  what exactly gives stories their extraordinary power?   Those who successfully mobilize mass harm make ample use of explicit and implicit stories.   With understanding and effort, those stories can be changed. Presser   s notable record of publications includes articles in top journals in the field as well as groundbreaking books with prestigious academic presses including Rutgers University Press, the University of Illinois Press, and the University of California Press. Early Career  Abner Salgado, Assistant Professor, Department of Mathematics Abner Salgado joined UT in August 2013. Following the completion of a doctorate in 2010 from Texas A&M University, he held a postdoctoral position at the University of Maryland from 2010 to 2013. He works on the numerical analysis of partial differential equations (PDEs). A fundamental feature of modern science is that complex physical phenomena are usually modeled via PDEs, but these equations are too difficult to solve explicitly. Professor Salgado   s research focuses on the design and analysis of algorithms for solving these equations computationally, employing deep methods from both numerical and classical analysis. His publication record is already extensive and includes the most prestigious journals in his field. He received a three-year single investigator grant from the National Science Foundation in 2014. These grants are highly competitive and proposals generally have a very low success rate. He has presented numerous invited lectures and colloquia at high-ranking venues and institutions. Shellen X. Wu, Assistant Professor, Department of History Since joining UT in 2011, Shellen Wu has won several of the most competitive national awards   including a Fulbright and an ACLS fellowship. This spring Stanford University Press published her book Empires of Coal  Fueling China   s Entry into the Modern World Order, 1860 t0 1920, described by a reviewer as    a brilliant and original cultural history of industrialization in late Qing China.    She is the first UT faculty member to publish an article in the American Historical Review, the nation   s lead journal across all disciplines in history. Her book and this article demonstrate her impressive ability to work with both Chinese and German sources, and to integrate the histories of geography, geology, energy policy, and comparative empires to advance our understanding of 20th century geopolitics in both Europe and Asia. She is one of a small number of young scholars who are looking beyond regional barriers to consider global context. Distinguished Research Career at UT Sally Horn, Chancellor   s Professor and Betty Lynn Hendrickson Professor, Department of Geography Sally Horn has served in the Department of Geography since 1987. She has amassed an impressive record that includes over 130 published pieces, over 325 conference presentations, and well over $6.5 million in research grants, with half of that funding coming from the National Science Foundation. A Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, she has played a major role in advancing our understanding of how humans have impacted the past environments of Central America, the Caribbean, and the southeastern U.S., the importance of fire in tropical environments, climate change throughout the Holocene, and how plant communities have responded to these changes. She has done this path-breaking work while advising many graduate students, nurturing undergraduate research experiences, coordinating the Initiative for Quaternary Paleoclimate Research, and carrying a full teaching load throughout her career. She is the recipient of several distinguished career awards within the field of geography. New Research, Scholarly and Creative Projects in the Arts and Humanities   Luke Harlow, Associate Professor, Department of History Luke Harlow has established himself as one of the leading voices in a new generation of scholars who examine the links between race and religion in American history. His book, Religion, Race, and the Making of Confederate Kentucky, 1830-1880, examines why the border state of Kentucky remained in the Union during the war, but developed a Confederate identity during the Reconstruction years, and ever since. His book demonstrates the important, and tragic, role that religion played in the process. For a brief time during Reconstruction, the religious idealists who led the antislavery crusade enjoyed a privileged place of power in Washington, which they put to use in a failed attempt to create a multi-racial democracy in the South. The role of religion as a motivation for their noble but failed project is a story that has not yet been properly recovered and is the focus of Luke Harlow   s future work. Interdepartmental Collaborative Scholarship and Research Nora Berenstain, Assistant Professor, Department of Philosophy Patrick Grzanka, Assistant Professor, Department of Psychology Patrick Grzanka and Nora Berenstain co-direct the Intersectionality Community of Scholars (ICOS) at UT, an interdisciplinary network of over twenty faculty whose work engages the ways that systems of inequality co-construct one another.   As a research paradigm, intersectionality is rooted in women of color   s critique of approaches to race that disregard gender dynamics and studies of gender that ignore the significance of race. It has transformed the way scholars and social justice advocates have studied the intersections of race, gender, class, sexuality, and other dimensions of social inequality. The ICOS aims to establish UT as a preeminent center for scholarship and creative activity on this critically important area of social, political, and cultural research. In 2016, the ICOS will bring international leaders in intersectionality studies to campus for a symposium about how intersectionality can inform the complex issues of social injustice and serve as a force for positive social change. Faculty Excellence in Teaching Awards Senior  Erin Hardin, Associate Professor and Director of Undergraduate Studies, Department of Psychology Erin Hardin has been recognized by her department twice for her teaching since joining UT in 2013. In the words of a student, she has transformed the teaching of Psychology 110 by making sure they are    getting the    bigger picture       and by teaching them    how to apply psychology outside of the classroom.    Another student writes,    I now look at the world from a different viewpoint and this has caused me to better understand the things that happen around me.    She also makes a difference in the graduate courses she teaches and through her efforts to help improve teaching throughout the department. As her departmental teaching review states,    Erin Hardin is the role model for the rest of us.    She is Co-PI on a recently funded five- year NIH grant from the Science Education Partnership (R25) designed to work with Appalachian high school students to reduce barriers to going to college. Harry    Hap    McSween, Chancellor   s Professor and Distinguished Professor of Earth & Planetary Sciences, Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences Harry    Hap    McSween has received multiple awards for his research, service and teaching at the departmental, college, campus, and national level, capped with recognition as UT Macebearer in 2014-15 and as SEC Professor of the Year in 2013. He holds a Leonard Medal from the Meteoritical Society and is a fellow of both the American Geophysical Union and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. His department head and nominator wrote    What is truly remarkable is that throughout his outstanding research and administrative career, Hap McSween has maintained a highly effective teaching program. Over the past 38 years, virtually every undergraduate major in geology and about a third of the graduate students in the department have taken at least one course from him. He is regarded by both students and faculty colleagues as an outstanding teacher, known for his ability to make the complex world of geology easier to understand. Junior  Jioni Lewis, Assistant Professor, Department of Psychology Jioni Lewis   s teaching is characterized by her devotion to the issues of diversity and social justice and for providing innovative experiential learning experiences for her students. She received an award from the UT Teaching Learning Center to expand the service-learning opportunities for her students in partnership with the Beck Cultural Exchange Center. She uses these experiences effectively to help students develop critical thinking skills and appreciation of multiple perspectives. A student wrote,    It helped me to not only analyze the material, but also what   s going on in the world around me.    Her teaching evaluations confirm that she impacting her students    development. She recently was awarded the nationally competitive 2015 Carolyn Payton Early Career Professional Award from Division 35 of the American Psychological Association. The award recognizes the achievement of a black woman who is an early career psychologist, specifically for published work addressing the concerns of black women and girls. Joan Lind, Associate Professor, Department of Mathematics Joan Lind   s teaching is summarized well in her department peer review     We found excellence in every area. Her students are delighted with her, and many find her teaching inspiring. She prepares carefully, organizing a course that gives students every opportunity to reach her high standards, which many do. Much of her success is due to her genuine concern for her students and her enthusiasm for the course material, regardless of level. Her record convinces us that she is already one of the finest instructors in the mathematics department.    Her care for her students is echoed in comments from her students and her teaching philosophy. She also is making a broader impact through her mentoring of graduate students and in her work to encourage more women to pursue study in math and science. She specializes in complex analysis and probability and teaches classes on differential equations and other areas of math. Lecturer Excellence in Teaching Award Theodora Kopestonsky, Lecturer, Department of Classics Theodora    Theo    Kopestonsky teaches courses ranging from introductory Latin to some 400-level courses, doing an excellent job in all. She engages the students by relating the ancient to the students    modern experience. A comment from the faculty nomination meeting perfectly summarizes their view of her contributions,    She is the best teacher in the department and everybody knows it.    Her student evaluations and comments echo this view, with one student exclaiming    She is truly made for teaching     she is wonderful!    Her impact goes beyond the classroom as several students provided unsolicited support saying that her enthusiasm for the material is so contagious that is has changed their lives as learners. She completed a doctorate in 2009 at the University at Buffalo where she held a Humanities Institute Dissertation Fellowship. Her interests include Greek and Roman Art and Archaeology, Corinthian Studies, Ancient Cult and Ritual Practice, Coroplastic Arts, and Gender in Antiquity. Malissa Peery, Distinguished Lecturer and Lower Division Chair, Department of Mathematics Malissa Peery   s list of accomplishments and awards is impressive, and, as her nomination says,    Malissa Peery is possibly the mathematics department   s finest instructor for GenEd and other math courses numbered below Math 141 (Calculus I). She is immensely popular with her students, in courses that students traditionally hate.    Her teaching evaluations are remarkably high for the level and type of courses she teaches. She has developed innovative teaching resources from clickers to note taking guides to a complete set of instructional videos. Beyond her own classes, she has made great contributions to the learning mission of the mathematics department through her tireless work as Lower Division Chair, coordinator of various courses, and as a mentor of first-year graduate teaching assistants. Student shout outs during the 2015 Faculty Appreciation Week thanked her for    awesome dedication to students, going above and beyond to help students succeed, and taking   stress out of math   . James R. and Nell W. Cunningham Outstanding Teaching Award Mary McAlpin, Professor and Associate Head, Department of Modern Foreign Languages and Literatures Mary McAlpin has been honored three times with teaching awards. Her vast experience in teaching French at all levels gives her a strong basis for understanding the challenges that students face when learning a new language. She is known for creating a comfortable but challenging classroom atmosphere, which has played an important role in her success as a teacher and as she moves towards helping her students learn to make effective oral presentations. Her classroom impact is captured in this comment from a student     I appreciate your  Dr. McAlpin   s  unending encouragements and amiable attitude. It was my absolute pleasure to be a student under your outstanding instruction   .    Her approach to the classroom, she hopes, will give students a    fascinating glimpse into another period and another way of viewing the world   .    Her interests include 18th-century French literature and culture, The Enlightenment, the French Revolution, the history of medicine, and gender theory.

As the semester comes to a close, I wish to share with you some good news. Faculty Awards 2015 The annual faculty awards ceremony was held this week on Tuesday evening, December 1, at the Holiday Inn World   s Fair Park. Previously faculty awards have been presented at the annual Winter Convocation in an afternoon program. Attendance at the Convocation has steadily declined (only seventy eight attended in 2014) and we observed that those who attended were mainly the faculty awardees and those who had nominated them. By changing the format to an evening program this year, we were aiming for a more intimate and meaningful ceremony which allowed the honorees, their significant others, and their nominators to participate in the celebration at a time that did not conflict with work schedules. The idea appears to have worked well in that all but two invited guests were able to attend. More importantly, many faculty remarked that they really appreciated the more intimate setting of the new format.     You may read about the award winners and their accomplishments at this link (include link).     Congratulations to all faculty who were recognized with awards this year. The Faculty Awards Ceremony each year is an occasion to recognize a few particularly outstanding faculty who represent the collective excellence of all faculty in the college. It   s an opportune time for me to express gratitude to all of our faculty, individually and collectively, for everything they do     teaching, research, service on college and university committees, and service to the community. We know that a college can be no greater than its faculty, and the College of Arts and Sciences is a college of excellence because of its outstanding faculty who are passionate about their discipline and who work selflessly to make our students, programs, departments, and the college the best they can be. Campus Chest Again this year, the college exceeded the goal set for us with the Campus Chest campaign!   Our goal was $74,000.   When all pledges were tallied, the college total was $76.366.24 was pledged   exceeding our goal by a small margin of three per cent. The generosity of our college will help so many people! Thank you! Overall, the university met 95% of the Campus Chest goal. Two Faculty Recently Named Fellows Annette Engel, Associate Professor in Earth and Planetary Sciences, who has been elected a Fellow of the Explorers Club (hyperlink to https   explorers.org  ). The club was founded in 1905 and its members have included Robert Peary, Roald Amundsen, Sir Edmund Hillary, Neil Armstrong, Mary Leakey, and Jane Goodall. The Explorer   s Club, established in 1904, is an international multidisciplinary professional society dedicated to the advancement of field research and the ideal that it is vital to preserve the instinct to explore. Established in 1904, the Club promotes the scientific exploration of land, sea, air, and space by supporting research and education in the physical, natural and biological sciences. Steven Steve Wilhelm, Kenneth and Blaire Mossman Professor of Microbiology, is one of the inaugural class of Sustaining Fellows of the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography (ASLO). ) ASLO is recognized as the international professional society for aquatic scientists. The honor recognizes his contributions to the advancements in aquatic science as well as his service contributions to this important professional society. Congratulations to Professors Engel and Wilhelm! Arts and Sciences Alumna, Dale Dickey, to Receive Honorary Degree Fall semester will end on a positive and uplifting note with the awarding of an Honorary Doctor of Science and Letters to alumna Dale Dickey (hyperlink to story). She will also deliver the graduation address for Fall Commencement. Our college has awarded only a few honorary degrees and there are many opportunities for more. I invite faculty to identify candidates for an honorary degree from the college and present them to department heads for consideration. In addition to being accomplished individuals, honorary degree candidates ideally would have a connection to the college, the university or the state. Best wishes for a pleasant finish to the semester and a restful and refreshing winter break. With best regards, Theresa M.

This exam is required for entrance into nearly all medical schools and is offered 25 or more times per year at Prometric test sites. The MCAT contains four test sections, listed in the order in which they are administered on the day of the exam  Biological and Biochemical Foundations of Living Systems (65 items, 95 minutes) Critical Analysis and Reasoning Skills (60 items, 90 minutes) Chemical and Physical Foundations of Biological Systems (65 items, 95 minutes) Psychological, Social, and Biological Foundations of Behavior (65 items, 95 minutes) Total scores are centered at 500, with scores ranging from 472 to 528.   Each section is scored on a range of 118 to 132, with a midpoint of 125.   The national average of students admitted to medical school in 2016 was 508.8. The Biological and Biochemical Foundations of Living Systems and Chemical and Physical Foundations of Biological Systems sections test concepts in biology, general and organic chemistry, biochemistry, and physics that medical school faculty rate as most important to entering students    success. These concepts are covered in introductory sequences in biology, general chemistry, organic chemistry, and physics and in first- semester biochemistry courses. The Critical Analysis and Reasoning Skills section asks you to analyze, evaluate, and apply information provided by passages from a wide range of social sciences and humanities disciplines. It does not require specific knowledge of these disciplines, but it tests the analysis and reasoning skills you need for medical school and may prompt you to read broadly as you prepare. Along with many others, passages about ethics, philosophy, cultural studies, and population health are included. The Psychological, Social, and Biological Foundations of Behavior section tests your knowledge of important introductory psychology and sociology concepts, as well as the introductory biology concepts that relate to mental processes and behavior.   The addition of this section to the exam recognizes the importance of socio-cultural and behavioral determinants of health and health outcomes. MCAT Test Preparation Regardless of the method you choose for test preparation, be sure to begin the review for the MCAT several months prior to the test date.   Your timing is important.   By sitting for the test early in the calendar year, you have two distinct advantages.   First, you will receive your scores   in   time   to   retake   the   test   if   you   are   not   satisfied   with   your   performance. Secondly, if your scores prove to be competitive, you can finish the application process by mid-summer, ahead of applicants who are taking one of the later exams. Given the proper preparation, the MCAT need not be as stressful as it is made out to be.   In addition to completing the required and recommended course work, there are other things you can do to prepare. For starters, be sure you review thoroughly all the free resources and information at your disposal through the AAMC  https   students-residents.aamc.org applying-medical-school taking-mcat-exam prepare-mcat-exam .

He takes over for Thomas Burman, who recently accepted the position of director of the Medieval Institute  at the University of Notre Dame. As the incoming director, Rubenstein   s first priority is to increase Marco   s visibility in the digital humanities. He also looks forward to working with the group of medieval scholars at the institute.    We are an extraordinarily active program with an international reputation for excellence,    says Rubenstein.    We have a number of very successful programs, including the Riggsby Lecture in medieval Mediterranean history, the manuscript workshop, and our spring symposium. We recently added a program of distinguished visiting scholars as well.    Before he left, Burman began developing a regional corridor in medieval studies, which Rubenstein plans to continue building.    Given our strengths in medieval studies and our geographic location, Marco has the potential to create a real academic network for medievalists in the southeast,    says Rubenstein, who looks forward to collaborating with schools such as Kentucky, Vanderbilt, Duke, and UNC on classes, symposia, and research projects. Another one of Rubenstein   s goals is to increase Marco   s footprint in the community and let people in Knoxville and beyond know more about medieval and Renaissance culture, and the exciting things going on in the program.    Marco is an astonishing success story. It is a model humanistic, interdisciplinary program. Having Marco on campus elevates the national and international reputation of the university as a place for the study of the humanities,    says Rubenstein.    Additionally, we have many excellent scholars in medieval history, literature, language, and art, which gives our students a unique opportunity to get to know a culture that is both distant in time and place, and yet crucial for shaping modern sensibilities.    Rubenstein spent the past year as associate director of the Humanities Center. He hopes to continue working with the center to put together programs and events of interest to the wider campus community.    It is an honor to be given this responsibility and opportunity,    says Rubenstein.","link":"https:\/\/artsci.utk.edu\/dialogue\/rubenstein-appointed-as-new-marco-director\/"},{"title":"Mastering Civil Discourse","content":"Mastering Civil Discourse Happy New Year and welcome back! I hope you all had a good break and are ready for another great semester. As we transition from 2016 to 2017, I would like to encourage everyone to think about improving and mastering civil discourse. Since the deeply divisive and polarizing political campaign, I have received several reports of emotional abuse and harassment between faculty and staff, and between faculty and students because of political disagreements or assumptions. Just as we expect students to engage in appropriate dialogue, it is expected between faculty and those over whom they have power relationships. It was very disappointing to discover incidents of faculty criticizing either students or staff about the election results     even when they had no knowledge (as is appropriate) of the individuals voting record     not that it is EVER appropriate to criticize an individual for how they voted. Throughout our lives, there will always be circumstances where we disagree with someone  but we must disagree with respect and discourse, not emotional accusations and abuse. We are fortunate to work in an environment where inclusivity, diversity, and dialogue are valued. We are also fortunate to work on a college campus where the free expression of ideas and discourse about ideas are encouraged. Every student on this campus interacts with our college at some point in their academic career. As the faculty and staff, it is important that we show leadership in the area of constructive discourse and civility in our departments, offices, and classrooms. If you disagree with a colleague, please do so with respect, integrity, and acceptance. If you have a problem or feel emotionally abused or manipulated because of what you believe in (or what someone thinks you believe in), please seek out help. Finally, I encourage you to watch this video and think about what civility means to you. Remember, VOL MEANS ALL is not just a slogan  it   s our mission. Sincerely, Theresa M. Lee, Dean","link":"https:\/\/artsci.utk.edu\/dialogue\/mastering-civil-discourse\/"},{"title":"Retirements","content":"Retirements Congratulations to the following on their retirement from the College of Arts & Sciences.

I will work to provide a vibrant, hospitable community,    says Elias.    I will also be working to inform people about the vital importance of the humanities to our society     its centrality to ethical and critical thinking about the traditions we   ve inherited and the future we want to create.    Elias will build on the work accomplished by founding director Thomas Heffernan, who retired in December 2016. Current programs include faculty fellowship awards, interdisciplinary seminars, public lectures, and distinguished lecture series. Elias plans to develop undergraduate and graduate student initiatives and create more faculty fellowship opportunities. A major goal is to move into a new state-of-the-art facility within the next five or six years.    I see the Humanities Center entering a second phase of development that will engage it publically with issues important to the national humanities, such as dialogue in the public sphere and the ethics of public rhetoric,    says Elias. The Humanities Center is an important part of the UT community and unique to the College of Arts and Sciences because it represents all of the humanities at UT.    The humanities have always been at the core of a liberal arts education,    says Elias.    The Center is a key advocate for the fundamental importance of the humanities to the intellectual life at UT. It is part of the transformative educational experience the study of humanities offers to our undergraduate and graduate students.    Humanities scholars share unique perspectives on art and beauty and aesthetic forms that are basic to a cognitive apprehension of the world, according to Elias.    We teach critical thinking habits and ethics essential to an informed citizenry, historical knowledge paramount to understanding the evolution of our diverse political and cultural institutions, and rhetorical and writing skills vital to making change in the world,    says Elias.    Today, in our tense and dangerous world, these are the approaches that give us insight and the skills that we need most to keep us vigilant and to keep us from misunderstanding, corruption, violence, and war.    Under Elias    leadership, the Humanities Center will continue to encourage interdisciplinary conversations among humanities scholars and develop new opportunities for the sharing of ideas in a communal space.

The reasons for this requirement include the fact that in-person meetings are far less likely to involve distractions and that personal cues such as body language may prompt an inquiry. The major reason for in-person appointments, though, is that sound relationships are best established in person, and the foundation of a good advising experience is a positive relationship between the advisor and the student. For this reason, telephone or video conference appointments are approved only under the most compelling of circumstances. Some examples of acceptable reasons are listed below. Active duty military students who are stationed overseas Physical incapacitation Inflexible work schedule (documentation from the employer required) If you have an SAP appeal and have already had your regular advising appointment with your advisor, you can coordinate that via email or phone. You may also ask your advisor to have a continuation of your regular appointment via email or phone if you have already satisfied your requirement for the term. That decision is left to the advisor   s discretion and is usually determined by the amount of information involved. Distance alone is not a major consideration. If you feel your reason is equivalent to those listed below, use the request form to submit an appeal to the policy. You may submit the form electronically to asadvising@utk.edu. You will receive a response from the committee in about 7-10 business days.

We do, however, acknowledge the potential conflict between our academic calendar and the interfaith calendar and want to make every reasonable effort to help students, faculty, and staff avoid negative academic consequences when their religious obligations conflict with academic requirements. Absence for religious reasons does not excuse students, faculty, or staff from responsibility for any part of academic or professional work required during the period of absence. Students will have a reasonable alternative opportunity to complete missed academic responsibilities. Faculty and staff will be responsible for work or hours missed during the period of absence. Should disagreement arise over any aspect of this guidance statement, the parties involved should contact the department chair or dean of the college.

We are proud to educate our students, through the lens of the liberal arts, to actively build a welcoming community that values critical inquiry, civil debate, and discovery. This allows us to celebrate our differences and moves us to a closer understanding of people with different beliefs, cultures, and backgrounds. As Associate Dean for Diversity, I serve as a member of Dean Lee   s cabinet and the college   s primary diversity liaison. I work with approximately eight campus and system-level diversity-related offices, as well as national diversity committees. I was appointed by the Chancellor as co-chair of the Vol Vision 2020 Diversity Priority Working Group. With the addition of diversity to the Vol Vision 2020 benchmarks, the College of Arts and Sciences stands poised to support and advance UT   s commitment to diversity and inclusion in its many forms. In our college, we have made progress to increase the diversity and retention of our faculty. We have also made progress in recruiting and retaining a diverse body of students through such programs as the Program for Excellence and Equity in Research (PEER), rigorous participation in the Tennessee Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (TLSAMP), and Math Camp. Each program is designed to increase student success in underrepresented minority students or lower socioeconomic students in the STEM fields. As a college, we provide financial support for diversity and inclusion programming and encourage faculty, staff, and student participation. Ready for the World events, which celebrate cultural diversity, are one example of progress in diversifying programs that we have seen across all our units. In Vol Vision 2020, the university adopted the diversity and inclusion statements of the American Association of Public and Land-grant Universities Commission for Access, Diversity, and Excellence. In our college, we consider diversity beyond the human experience of self and apply the concept to the long history of a liberal arts education. Part of that liberal arts education is diversity in experiences, which our students and faculty bring to the classrooms. It is crucial for the development of our societies    future leaders to support appropriate diversity initiatives our faculty, staff, and students see as important. We also need to continue to bring disparate groups and people together to build a more inclusive community with respect for different backgrounds and experiences. Productive dialogue and the civil exchange of ideas can be a challenge in today   s climate. Without an emphasis on inclusion, however, any diversity efforts will fall short as they will promote the canard that only exceptional individuals from underrepresented groups can compete with     and expect the respect of     the majority. We seek to recognize and eliminate barriers that define the interests of the majority and minority as at odds. Inclusiveness recognizes that underrepresented populations are a key part of, not ancillary to, the whole. One of our goals is to proactively identify and eliminate barriers to increasing the number of people from underrepresented populations within the college. We expect our graduates to embrace diversity and inclusion as a source of lifelong learning, personal fulfillment, and creative possibility. We should expect the same things from our own community. The University of Tennessee should be a place where the most dynamic, diverse, and profound learning environment can be found. We can and should create this environment. It is the right thing to do, not only for the present, but for future generations. -Angie Batey Associate Dean for Diversity and Inclusion Professor of Conducting, School of Music","link":"https:\/\/artsci.utk.edu\/dialogue\/diversity-liberal-arts-tradition\/"},{"title":"Arts &#038; Sciences in the News","content":"Arts & Sciences in the News Over the summer, several faculty in the college received local, regional, and national attention for their research and scholarly work.

Thanks to a grant from The Roy Cockrum Foundation, his dream is finally a reality. Next August and September, players on the Clarence Brown stage and performers in the KSO will collaborate on a production of Leonard Bernstein   s acclaimed operetta, Candide.    Leonard Bernstein is the most indispensable figure in the history of American concert music,    says Aram Demirjian, KSO music director.    It brings us great joy to be able to celebrate his legacy through the performance of Candide, one of his most distinctive and enduring masterworks.    A number of derivative works came from Voltaire   s satirical novella, released in France in 1759. In Bernstein   s musical, a young man wanders    the best of all possible worlds    only to find war, destruction and loss. Separated from his beloved, Candide   s hard-won survival ends in a joyous reconciliation. Leonard Bernstein revamped the musical Candide several times after its London premiere in 1956. When Bernstein   s    final approved    version of this comedic, poignant story reappeared on Broadway in 1989 with a full score, a revival was born. This version continues to be revived and performed in opera and professional theaters and is the score and libretto the KSO CBT will perform in 2018, known as    the Scottish Opera version.    The production is made possible by a generous grant from The Roy Cockrum Foundation, whose mission is to support world-class performing arts projects in not-for-profit professional theaters throughout the United States.    We   ve been helping theaters all over the country make their dreams come true,    says Cockrum, a theater enthusiast who started his foundation with proceeds from winning the Powerball Lottery in 2014 on a ticket he purchased in Knoxville.    I   m very glad to help make this amazing project possible right here in my hometown and look forward to the production.    Other grant recipients of The Roy Cockrum Foundation include such prestigious theaters as Chicago   s Steppenwolf Theatre Company, The Goodman Theatre, Washington DC s Woolly Mammoth Theatre Company, and The Acting Company of New York.    The more our local artistic institutions work together, the stronger our community will be,    Demirjian says.    We could not be more grateful to The Roy Cockrum Foundation for supporting this renewed collaboration between the KSO and CBT.    Directed by Calvin MacLean and conducted by Aram Demirjian, the performances will take place August 29     September 16, 2018, on the mainstage of the Clarence Brown Theatre at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.","link":"https:\/\/artsci.utk.edu\/dialogue\/dream-come-true\/"},{"title":"Important Reminders for Faculty &#038; Staff","content":"Important Reminders for Faculty & Staff Title IX Training     Mandatory Reporters As a UT employee, you are a    mandatory reporter    and are expected to complete the online education program Haven for Faculty and Staff.

The goal of the project is to gain a better understanding of job descriptions and classifications in preparation for a market-based benchmarking survey.    We are trying to get an accurate description of jobs so the compensation staff has a better understanding of the breadth and depth of positions on campus,    says Jennifer Barnett, assistant finance director in the College of Arts and Sciences.    The goal of this project is to properly categorize current positions, not reclassify positions into new pay grades. Salaries will not be affected by this process.    The first phase of the project implemented a new position description form that made it easier to create and update staff position descriptions. Phase two involves the review and update of all job families. Over the next year, members of the human resources team will group the job families based on similar type of work and required training, skill, knowledge, and expertise.    We need to identify positions and develop a more logical framing and organization of the job families in order to clarify the differences between jobs and pay grades,    Barnett says. Research, finance, and administrative positions are the current job families under review. The team has not announced the next group, but a meeting is in the works for December to slot the research, finance, and administrative positions into job families. In 2009, the university officials conducted a standard review of all the positions to make sure they were classified accurately. Since then, however, job positions have not adjusted to the market, which makes it difficult for HR representatives to make salary decisions. The third phase of the project is to develop a market-based pay structure. The project is budget-neutral, which means salaries will not change as part of this project. Closing gaps in pay will take time, but the assessment will better position UT to address market competitiveness.","link":"https:\/\/artsci.utk.edu\/dialogue\/considering-compensation\/"},{"title":"Exceeding Expectations","content":"Exceeding Expectations Each year, the Volunteer family gives back to our community through the Campus Chest Campaign.

The reward? An additional $500,000 to help us meet the $1 million goal. Thanks to the generosity of our Volunteer community, we exceeded the $1 million goal and the Herberts designated their challenge gift to the Writing Center.    The Writing Center is very dear to my heart,    says Judi Herbert, who graduated UT in 1963 with an English degree.    I wanted to contribute to something that could serve not just freshman in the College of Arts and Sciences, but could make an impact on the entire university.    Growing up, Judi loved to read. She was also good in math and science, however, and scored high enough on entrance exams that it looked like she was headed in that direction.    I started out in education and during that time, it seemed most girls would be a teacher, which didn   t appeal to me at all,    Judi says.    During my first year of college, I started taking literature courses and became a grader for a teacher of a freshman English course. That   s when I developed a love for English.    Over the years, Judi has continued to work with college students, but she has noticed a disturbing trend. Recent college graduates do not have good writing skills.    I   ve just been appalled at their writing skills,    Judi says.    When we became re-involved with UT, I wanted to make sure that no one would graduate from our university with the kind of writing skills I was seeing from some other very fine schools.    Judi and Jim (   62) met with people from the Writing Center and decided their support could help expand the reach and impact of the Center not only for freshman taking an English course, but for students in upper-level courses in different majors, as well as graduate school.    It doesn   t make a difference what students are doing     nuclear physics, business, science, agriculture     they still have to be able to express it,    Judi says.    It   s one thing to know it, but to be able to communicate it to someone else, to be able to write for applications, resumes, publications or any kind of paper, is important. We see so many people come out of other disciplines that have never been taught how important it was to be able to express themselves so that other people can understand the subject or issue at hand.    Kirsten Benson, director of the Writing Center, says the Herberts  gift will make a big impact on the number of students the Center serves.    We   ve pulled back a bit in the past couple of years because we were getting too big and felt we couldn   t provide what the students need,    Kirsten says.    The Herberts  gift will help start an undergraduate tutoring program. We will also be able to offer more targeted help to first-year students.    The Herberts  generosity will also make it possible to expand the services offered in the Writing Center, including the kind of help offered to upper-division students who are not English majors.    We want to provide the upper-division students with more discipline-specific support for their writing,    says Allen Dunn, head of the Department of English.    We also want to be able to work with faculty across campus to make sure we are giving students exactly the kind of guidance they need.    Jim and Judi Herbert are excited to begin their journey of support for the Writing Center and to give back to the university.    Jim   s philosophy in life is    To whom much is given, much is expected,       Judi says.    We make that our philosophy for philanthropy. We   re just thrilled to be at a point in our lives where we can do more, give back, and make a difference.

According to a 2016 National Center for Education Statistics report, 14.5 percent of students nationwide took at least one distance education course in the fall 2014 semester. While we have dipped our toes in the waters of online education, we are far from the average. One of Chancellor Davenport   s priorities is to expand UT   s online course offerings. Our response in the College of Arts and Sciences is two-fold. We will develop online masters-level programs and convert existing courses to a hybrid or online format primarily for the summer sessions. Both of these options provide students (those at UT and those    out there   ) with additional options for taking courses and have the potential to provide more funds to the offering department through tuition return. So what is our plan? Online master   s programs are expensive. The structure of an online course should produce enough revenue to cover development costs. They also need to generate enough additional profit for the department to justify the investment. In order to identify areas within the college that could support such a program, we are collaborating with the Provost   s office, as well as searching on our own, to find consultants that could help us with this effort. In addition to identifying areas for online master   s programs, we anticipate the consultants could also help with the marketing and possible management of the programs. If you are interested in offering an online master   s program in your department, please conduct a self-evaluation to identify programs that might have a broad appeal. Please send your ideas to Todd Moore, associate dean of graduate studies, who is spearheading this effort. Online summer courses are less expensive to develop and a great way for faculty to wade in the waters of online education. For years, we have provided support for the development of online summer courses. We will continue our efforts, offering a faculty member a stipend or research funds of $2,500 to develop and deliver online summer courses. Once we confirm an online summer course, the instructor works with staff from OIT and TN-TLC during the spring semester to convert the course to an online format and offer it the following summer. Once a course is converted, we can continue to offer it during summer sessions and even during the fall or spring semesters. Please look at high-demand courses within your department and consider the viability of offering them as an online course. We will send out requests for proposals in early December. Now is as good a time as ever to consider how you might dive into online education. If you have questions, please email me.

They met professors, walked through a tropical greenhouse, and braved the heat of the day along the way. Their trip ended not on an uncharted desert isle, but in the cool refuge of Ayres Hall on the Mighty Hill. The three-hour tour gave her a taste of the offerings in the College of Arts and Sciences. The tour began at the Clarence Brown Theatre where Chancellor Davenport met faculty and students in the Department of Theatre. Director Cal MacLean shared the history of the department and some of the challenges they face     mainly the lack of a unified home for the department. In the Carousel Theatre, Davenport spent a few minutes talking with students and learning about their experiences. She joined them on the stage for a few photos before leaving the cool, quite of the Carousel for the bright, busy floors of McClung Tower. English professors, including Margaret Lazarus Dean and Department Head Allen Dunn, met Davenport and Lee outside the Writing Center. A chance encounter with Joy Harjo occurred, and afterwards, Davenport walked through the threshold of the Writing Center to meet students and learn more about how the Center helps them succeed. Lee, ever cautious of the time restraints, ushered Davenport to the infamous McClung elevator to continue the tour in the heart of the humanities. When the doors opened, Davenport and Lee stepped into the international world of the Department of Modern Foreign Languages and Literatures. Department Head Adrian Del Caro, students, and lecturers led Davenport around the floor as they shared the breadth and depth of the department. The group came to a stop in a small room where students and lecturers meet. With two sessions in progress, the room looked sufficient  but Davenport soon learned that despite the view, the room was simply too small to accommodate the eight lecturers that called the space their office. Davenport began to see the theme of the tour     space. Not the space planetary scientists explore, but the space needed to provide the foundational skills each student at the University of Tennessee receives from the College of Arts and Sciences. Sociology was the next stop on the tour. Davenport visited with several professors and learned, to her surprise, UT does not have a social science research center. She praised the work of social justice warriors and learned that faculty in the department considered sociology one of the most engaged departments on campus. As the duo left the Tower, Jon Shefner, department head and consummate rabble-rouser, reminded Davenport of the important issue at-hand     outsourcing. She smiled and nodded her head as Lee led her through the plaza to their next stop     the School of Art. David Wilson, director, and several students met Lee and Davenport at the Ewing Gallery, but did not have much time to talk before Davenport stepped into the gallery to admire the installations. Art on walls, on the floor, art in a room within a room     the gallery showcased several unique pieces. Davenport asked when the walls in her office would be covered with this art, but never quite got an answer. She did, however, understand the importance of the gallery as a graduate recruiting tool. Lee tried to pull Davenport away from the awe of the Ewing several times, and finally succeeded on the fourth attempt. Running a few minutes behind, the duo briskly walked through the Humanities Plaza, across the Pedestrian Bridge, and into the Burchfiel Geography Building. Ron Kalafsky, geography department head, students, and a few other faculty were already waiting for their opportunity to meet the Chancellor. Relieved to sit a few moments, Davenport engaged the students in a conversation about the variety of programs within the department. She also learned the sad fact that in Tennessee, most students did not know geography was a job option. Outreach and education is key to this problem and a point the group made loud and clear during the discussion. After a quick walk through the hall to view the ancient maps, Lee and Davenport began their journey up the Hill     a right-of-passage and a walk Davenport had yet to make since joining the Volunteer family. Lee   s home department of psychology concluded the social sciences portion of the tour. In Austin Peay, Davenport visited a cognitive research lab and discussed the issues of opioid use in Tennessee with Deb Welsh, department head, but a tropical paradise awaited Lee and Davenport. Susan Kalisz, department head of ecology and evolutionary biology, greeted Lee and Davenport at Hesler to show off the recently renovated greenhouses. Like the Ewing Gallery, the greenhouses captured Davenport   s attention as she walked through the living showcase of tropical plants and flowers. Students shared their experience working and researching in the greenhouses, but time was running out. Lee had less than an hour to finish the tour and still had two departments on her list. At Buehler Hall, Chuck Feigerle, department head, and Shawn Campagna showed Davenport a chemistry lab, which looked much different from the ones in Strong Hall. A graduate student in the lab briefly talked with Davenport about his research and experience as a chemistry major until it was time to leave. With one more stop and 20 minutes left on the clock, Lee ushered Davenport out of Buehler for the final push up the Hill to the entrance of Ayres Hall. On the second floor, Conrad Plaut, head of the Department of Mathematics, two faculty, and a few students waited to share the success of Math Camp. Davenport was impressed by the impact the program had on student success and asked why it was not part of every university   s curriculum. Lee smiled and responded that she hoped it would be soon. Finally, at 3 59 p.m., Davenport and Lee entered the Dean   s Suite, taking the final step of their three-hour tour. Associate deans in the college, who thought it might be impossible to finish the tour in three hours, applauded Dean Lee   s accomplishment and greeted the Chancellor with warm smiles and cookies. Davenport stayed for one final photo before moving on to her next appointment. Although her three-hour tour of the College of Arts and Sciences was over, Chancellor Davenport began a new journey to share the importance of the college as the gateway of knowledge for the University of Tennessee.","link":"https:\/\/artsci.utk.edu\/dialogue\/three-hour-tour\/"},{"title":"Best Practices for Accessibility in Planning Conferences and Meetings","content":"Best Practices for Accessibility in Planning Conferences and Meetings In planning for conferences or meetings, here is a list of possible best practices to organize the event(s) so they are as accessible as possible for all types of people.

After a few years, she discovered the need to provide a more hands-on experience for her students.    Students read and learn communications, marketing, and advertising concepts, as well as explore the impact the growing Hispanic population of East Tennessee has on local business models. They did not, however, have the opportunity to apply the skills they learned in the classroom to real-world situations,    says Toledo, senior lecturer of Spanish in the Department of Modern Foreign Languages and Literatures.    I started looking for community partners interested in marketing their product or service to the growing East Tennessee Hispanic market.    Students have worked on projects from promoting fuel efficiency to advertising community resources. This year, Toledo and her students collaborated with WonderWorks in Pigeon Forge, which bills itself as    an amusement park for the mind.    The attraction combines education and entertainment with over 100 hands-on exhibits. The semester-long project provided students an opportunity to apply their language skills to a real-world project by designing a Spanish-language flyer promoting WonderWorks and talking directly to the Hispanic community about the park. The end product was an advertising campaign for the Hispanic community the students presented to the client     WonderWorks     at the end of the semester. Chris Siler, a student majoring in Spanish and a local business owner, found the experience to be very beneficial to both his academic career and his business.    It   s one thing to learn a language in a vacuum, but to get your brain thinking about how to put your course load to work makes it sink in,    Siler says.    I never realized I was making my company unattractive to the growing Hispanic population. When we began to look at some things that would help WonderWorks, I quickly looked at my own business and realized we were getting caught in the same pitfalls. I look forward to making some changes and tapping into a new customer base.    Katelyn Robinson, a public relations major, needed to fulfill her foreign language requirement before going abroad. When her advisor told her about this course, she jumped at the opportunity to take a course that would also help her in her chosen field of PR.    This class was great because it utilized my major while learning a new language. Being able to do all the things I would normally do in English and then taking my learning further was very rewarding,    Robinson says.    I am glad UT offers a foreign language course specific enough to learn about the importance of communications strategy.    Another course Toledo brings hands-on learning to is her Intermediate Spanish Honors course, which is designed to meet the more rigorous needs of honors students. After teaching the course for a couple of years, however, Toledo realized the students needed more of a challenge. Armed with a Teaching for Innovation grant from the Teaching and Learning Center, Toledo came up with an idea to have students conduct interviews with the local Hispanic community.    I believe that in the current political climate, the spoken histories of the Hispanic community needed to be recorded somewhere, so this semester students designed and conducted interviews and recorded them using the Story Corps app,    Toledo says. Students met and conducted interviews with members of the Hispanic community at Centro Hispano, a nonprofit organization that helps the Hispanic community by promoting empowerment and civic participation of the multicultural community through education and social services.    The project itself was very fun and interesting,    says DJ Garcia, Spanish honors student.    I was a bit anxious prepping for the interview, but once we started, I felt more and more comfortable speaking in Spanish and even started asking questions that weren   t on my list.    During his interviews, Garcia discovered there were several people who had struggles similar to his parents and family.    It reminded me of my trips to Mexico and how close my family was as a whole,    Garcia says.    It changed my perspective entirely and made me appreciate my parents    sacrifice even more.    Kristen Peterson was not very thrilled to learn she had to interview a fluent Spanish-speaker     in Spanish.    I was so nervous because I did not think I was good enough to hold a 20-minute conversation with a fluent speaker,    Peterson says. When she met her interviewee, Jose, she relaxed and enjoyed hearing his story.    It was very inspiring. He faced so much adversity and hardship in his life, but he still continues to work very hard and have a positive attitude,    Peterson says.    I truly believe that people who do not want immigrants in our country should talk to an immigrant and understand their story. You realize they are real people trying to be successful and make a good life for themselves. They work so hard for themselves and their family. I really enjoyed talking to him.    The Centro Hispano project provided a bridge from classroom learning to real-world learning, an important piece of the experience-learning puzzle. Students apply cultural awareness to design the interview and use their command of Spanish to listen and understand the response.    Research has shown that hands-on, experimental learning not only makes students feel more engaged, but also helps them retain material as they connect what they are learning to real life. My classes serve to introduce students to situations they will face on the job market,    Toledo says.    Experience learning is a very important part of higher education. UT benefits every time students have the opportunity to get their hands on something real through a program or course.

Every year, she puts on an Alumni Clinic in which members of the organization can connect with alumni and learn from their experiences. Since we are a student-run team, Holly is the closest thing we have to a coach. We think of her as the debate team    mom.    She has even connected with other coaches across the state to figure out how our debate team can function better and more smoothly.    Congratulations Holly on your well-deserved award!","link":"https:\/\/artsci.utk.edu\/dialogue\/sullivan-honored-work-tennessee-speech-debate-society\/"},{"title":"Wrapping Up the Semester","content":"Wrapping Up the Semester As we close out the year and prepare for our winter break, I would like to thank everyone in our college for your work and dedication to our community. From debates about outsourcing to dealing with the stress of uncertainty over faculty hires, support for our graduate students, and support for marginalized populations, it has been an unsettling semester year. The good news is that many things are better than they were a year ago. Despite some disappointments (e.g., men   s sport), we have accomplished several important things in the past year. First, we will start the new year with updated college bylaws and a new strategic plan that provides a roadmap to success over the next five years. The long-awaited opening of Strong Hall is behind us and both students and faculty are truly grateful for the wonderful, state-of-the-art facility. Next year, we will move into the new Mossman Building, allowing another set of students and faculty the joy of a modern facility. Several of our programs continue to be ranked in the top 25 and EVERY program is ranked in the top 50. This is an accomplishment when most of our units can count their competitors in over a thousand units. Students    successes across all disciplines consistently provide us with bragging rights on campus and nationally as they win prestigious awards. Finally, we publicly launched the Join the Journey campaign and look forward to the growing impact the generosity of our alumni, donors, and friends will have on our college and the university as a whole. The first noticeable change for our students will be an increase in services from the Writing Center, which will expand to provide more services because of Judi and Jim Herbert   s wonderful gift. I hope you enjoy your time off. From all of us here in Ayres Hall, we wish you the happiest of winter solstice holidays     Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah, and Happy Kwanza. Sincerely, Theresa Lee Dean, College of Arts and Sciences","link":"https:\/\/artsci.utk.edu\/dialogue\/wrapping-up-the-semester\/"},{"title":"Faculty Honored at Annual Banquet","content":"Faculty Honored at Annual Banquet The 2017 College of Arts and Sciences faculty awards ceremony took place Thursday, December 7 at the Holiday Inn Downtown. Hosted by Dean Theresa Lee, this annual event recognizes faculty for their outstanding work in a variety of areas. Congratulations to the following on your award! Diversity Leadership Award Adam Cureton, Department of Philosophy An associate professor of philosophy, Adam Cureton specializes in ethics, Kant, and the philosophy of disability. Cureton is the founder of the Society for Philosophy and Disability, which promotes inclusiveness for people with disabilities in philosophy. He has served for several years on the Chancellor   s Commission for Diversity and Inclusion. He has also served on the American Philosophical Association   s Committee on Inclusiveness in the Professions and its Diversity Task Force and is the faculty advisor for the student group Campus Disability Advocates. Faculty Advising Service Award Michelle Christian, Department of Sociology Michelle Christian, assistant professor of sociology, is honored for her work as advisor, teacher, and mentor to her advisees and the students in the sociology honors concentration. Christian   s approach to advising embodies the principle that advising is teaching. With her cross-disciplinary knowledge, she not only encourages her students to create an academic plan that has multi-disciplinary breadth, but she also challenges them to consider diverse career paths and prepare for alternatives. Sarah Lebeis, Department of Microbiology Sarah Lebeis, assistant professor of microbiology, is recognized for her work advising undergraduates in the Department of Microbiology. Recognizing that her advisees bring different academic and socioeconomic backgrounds to the university, she takes the time to discuss success and career strategies that align with each of their personalities, as well as their academic challenges and strengths. Another focus of her advising approach is career exploration and planning. As the advisor of the Microbiology Undergraduate Club, she has guided members in developing a series of career-focused programs that range from identifying research opportunities to securing positive faculty recommendations. Excellence in Research Creative Achievement Award, Senior Faculty Kate Jones, Department of Physics & Astronomy Professor Kate Jones has built an outstanding research career at the intersection of nuclear structure, nuclear reactions, and nuclear astrophysics. Her discoveries prompted theoreticians to develop more accurate models of exotic, neutron-rich isotopes. Over the past five years, Jones published more than 20 peer-reviewed articles. Jones serves on the Scientific Advisory Board of the national Facility for Rare Isotope Beams, the $1B laboratory under construction in Michigan. She is also member of the prestigious Nuclear Science Advisory Committee (NSAC). Excellence in Research Creative Achievement Award, Mid-Career Faculty John Powers, School of Art Associate Professor John Powers is a multi-faceted artist whose creative work includes kinetic sculpture, carved marble and wood, video animation and projection, and systematic drawing. In a very short time, Powers has been able to build a remarkable creative research record that includes a considerable list of first-class exhibitions. He has also received several very prestigious awards, including a 2016 John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship in Creative Arts, a Virginia A. Groot Foundation, 1st Place Award  the Manifest Prize from the Manifest Creative Research and Drawing Center  and was a featured Artist-in-Residence at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Haidong Zhou, Department of Physics & Astronomy Assistant Professor Zhou Haidong is a world-renowned researcher who designs novel    quantum matter    materials, which are of great interest as materials platforms for quantum computing and other transformative quantum technologies that are expected to revolutionize data storage and information processing. He has published close to 200 peer-reviewed articles, many of them appeared in top journals, and work is currently cited over 500 times each year. Zhou received the prestigious NSF Early Career Award in 2014 for his studies of quantum magnetism in pyrochlores. Excellence in Research Creative Achievement Award, Early Career Faculty Sarah Eldridge, Department of Modern Foreign Languages & Literatures Assistant Professor Sarah Eldridge   s outstanding portfolio of research includes a monograph published in 2016, four refereed journal articles published, two refereed journal articles in press, one more refereed article commissioned for a special issue, and one book chapter accepted for an edited volume. Eldridge has a contract with Oxford University Press for a co-edited volume on Goethe   s Wilhelm Meister   s Apprenticeship and Philosophy, to which she will also contribute a chapter. Since arriving at UT, Eldridge has had nine conference presentations and four book reviews. Eldridge has received external funding, including a highly competitive DAAD German Academic Exchange Service Summer Seminar at the University of Chicago in 2013 and a Fulbright Research Grant to Germany in 2016. Patrick Grzanka, Department of Psychology Assistant Professor Patrick Grzanka   s scholarship examines how multiple forms of inequality intersect to create and maintain systemic oppression   or,    intersectionality.    Because inequality crosses disciplinary boundaries, Grzanka   s work is interdisciplinary, drawing from psychology, sociology, and science and technology studies while employing both quantitative and qualitative analysis. With funding from the NSF, Grzanka has critiqued normative therapeutic approaches to sexual orientation and developed new models that seek to affirm all sexualities and gender expressions. With recent funding from the American Psychological Association, he studied the effects of Tennessee   s law that allows counselors to deny services to anyone based on    sincerely held principles.    His important findings have demonstrated that awareness of the bill may have significant effects on LGBT+ Tennesseans    mental health and their willingness to seek mental health services. Distinguished Research Career at UT Mike Lofaro, Department of English Professor Michael Lofaro has taught English at UT since 1975. He is a broad-ranging scholar whose work falls into three distinctive categories of American literature. He is a scholar of the early national period, the frontier and frontier hero in American literature and culture, and the works of Knoxville native James Agee. The general editor of the eleven-volume scholarly edition of The Works of James Agee, Lofaro is also the scholarly editor of two of those eleven volumes. This is the first complete edition of the works of Agee. Lofaro is also a fine teacher who has taught a wide variety of courses. New Research, Scholarly, and Creative Projects in the Arts and Humanities Jacob Latham, Department of History Associate Professor Jacob Latham has published award-winning work on the circus parade in Late Antique Rome, one of the empire   s most important political and religious pageants. Supported by this award, he will look more broadly at what such ceremonies can tell us about the centuries-long struggle for authority between Rome   s pagan and Christian powers. Latham   s ambitious work requires mastery of multiple disciplines. In his attempt to provide a richer understanding of the role of religion in the Roman Empire and the gradual victory of Christian over pagan authority, he must command not only the literature that has survived from pagan and Christian elites, but also the civic rituals, material culture, and popular religious practices as they evolved over several centuries. He aims to bring together the insights of history, religious studies, archaeology, and historical sociology. This award will be invaluable in supporting that research. Interdepartmental Collaborative Scholarship and Research Michelle Christian, Department of Sociology Jioni Lewis, Department of Psychology As assistant professors, Michelle Christian and Jioni Lewis co-founded the Critical Race Collective, an interdisciplinary research group that brings together faculty across campus focused on critical race issues in research, teaching, and engagement. They also developed an innovative interdisciplinary research project utilizing a mixed methods approach to investigate the race-related and campus climate experiences of students of color at the university. This research and the Critical Race Collective provide exemplars of innovative interdisciplinary research and collaboration that has the potential to positively impact the campus community and beyond, while also leading to high quality and nationally competitive grant fundable research. Excellence in Teaching Award, Senior Faculty Stephanie Bohon, Department of Sociology Associate Professor Stephanie Bohon has aligned her position as director of graduate studies in sociology with her deep understanding of and concern for the needs of graduate students. This is reflected in her courses, but even more so in how she reaches out to all the graduate students in her department and even to some in other units. One area of focus is writing. She organized grant writing workshops for all students, offered to give feedback on drafts of journal articles and conference presentations, and promoted weekly    write-ins    for students and faculty across campus. Steven Wilhelm, Department of Microbiology Professor Steven Wilhelm co-developed and successfully teaches a course to help students transition to upper-level microbiology courses. He led the department in applying for an NSF REU program. One of Wilhelm   s interests is aquatic microbiological research, which has led him to take 20-plus students over the past three years into the middle of the Pacific Ocean and other exotic locations. A student wrote of the experience     Working in a university lab may have its challenges, but it takes a truly outstanding mentor to teach you how to place filters on a rig in 20-foot seas.    Excellence in Teaching Award, Junior Faculty Patrick Grzanka, Department of Psychology Assistant Professor Patrick Grzanka connects his research and passion to the content and pedagogy in his courses and to all that he does for his students and the university. Grzanka is an exceptional scholar-teacher whose innovative, interdisciplinary scholarship and teaching have made a substantial impact on the study of intersectionality. His tireless work in the classroom, on our campus, and in the greater psychological community demonstrates a commitment to social transformation and an expansive vision of critical pedagogy that promotes social justice, particularly for members of multiply marginalized groups Marie Jameson, Department of Mathematics Assistant Professor Marie Jameson   s excellence extends beyond the classroom. She is a risk taker and successfully redesigned a course under the    flipped    style. She shares her knowledge with GTAs and co-mentors them as they teach calculus. She is also continuing to grow as an instructor by trying new pedagogies and participating in a TN-TLC program and the Mathematical Association of America   s Project NExT program. Excellence in Teaching Award, Lecturers Marcel Brouwers, Department of English Marcel Brouwers, senior lecturer, has found the sweet spot of being human and still teaching the discipline involved in reading literature and in writing (both compositions and creatively). He has taught a variety of courses that mostly enroll non-majors and has received excellent student evaluations. In classroom conversations about a poem, he was able to remain open to and encourage various ideas from the students, while still drawing those ideas back to the bigger themes of the course. He strives to share his own excitement with his students and, as he writes in his teaching philosophy     Being a student is not easy  It can be arduous and slow going     I am available to help, to guide, and, with luck, to teach.    Laura Trujillo-Mejia, Department of Modern Foreign Languages & Literatures There are many elements that indicate excellence in teaching  great student evaluations and comments, high standards, and constant innovation. Distinguished Lecturer Laura Trujillo-Mejia attains all these, and in her teaching philosophy, captures them under a simple idea         to be a successful teacher, one needs to be a good learner.    This philosophy has led her to develop new ways to teach her courses, including flipping Spanish 323. She participates in activities with the TN-TLC and has been awarded grants to improve her courses. Her students appreciate her work with exceptionally high evaluations and strong comments. Her colleagues appreciate her innovation and the quality of her work, giving her the highest marks among all lecturers in the department in 2015. James R. and Nell W. Cunningham Outstanding Teaching Award Millie Gimmel, Department of Modern Foreign Languages & Literatures Teaching involves addressing many different goals  the content, the culture behind the content, the role of the humanities in understanding culture, and the value of all student voices. Associate Professor Millie Gimmel is able to bring all these together in her classroom by her own detailed preparation and by the way she engages the students in the discussion. An observer of her class noted how she made sure all students were encouraged to engage. This reflects in her teaching philosophy of providing a safe place for all students to discuss and examine cultures that are different from their own. Michael Olson, Department of Psychology Professor Michael Olson starts his teaching philosophy with the value of a good classroom  comfortable, marked by mutual respect and freedom. His classes are entertaining, but the learning is significant. In his Psychology of Prejudice course, students engage in    intergroup dialogues    (structured conversations among diverse populations), and participate and then write about experiences where they were in the minority. The enthusiasm he brings to the classroom makes it an ideal place for deep and significant learning Faculty Academic Outreach Award for Teaching Karen Lloyd, Department of Microbiology From Costa Rica to the TED talk stage in Milan, Assistant Professor Karen Lloyd   s academic outreach efforts cover a broad range of activities. In 2012, Lloyd and her colleague Drew Steen founded the Aquatic Geochemistry Team, an ongoing program at the primarily minority Malcom X. Shabazz High School in New Jersey. The impact of this outreach program inspires students who deal with very harsh realities in their daily life to continue their education after high school. Lloyd   s role as an ambassador of science does not stop there. She has been part of ongoing outreach to the greater public. One example is her efforts in the development of short films on her research, such as the Deep Carbon Observatory research in Costa Rica. During the 2016 Olympics, Lloyd illuminated microbes through a popular lens in an article that demonstrated the novel capabilities of microbes within the context of how they might be perceived as competing in Olympic events. In this year alone, Lloyd has presented her research at the UT MicNite, created the Center for Dark Energy Biosphere Investigations Professional Development Webinar, served on a panel at the world conference for science journalists, and presented at TED Talk in Milan, Italy. Faculty Academic Outreach Award for Service Julie Reed , Department of History Since coming to UT in 2011, Associate Professor Julie Reed has done much to enrich the study of Native American history by developing a slate of innovative courses, organizing a series of lectures on Native American topics, collaborating with colleagues to build an interdisciplinary program, and advising and mentoring Native American student groups. Another important dimension of her work is the service she provides as a scholar of Native American history and a member of the Cherokee tribe to Native American communities in our region and beyond. This work exemplifies the aim of this award, to recognize someone who brings faculty experience to the service of a wider community. Her work has helped both the Cherokee and their neighbors to develop a deeper understanding of a shared history that is foundational to an understanding of our region. The value of her outreach serves not only Native American communities, but enriches our undergraduate courses and our wider campus community. Faculty Academic Outreach Award for Research & Creative Activity Henri Grissino-Mayer, Department of Geography For years, Professor Henri Grissino-Mayer voiced concerns about the potential fire situation in and around Gatlinburg. In November of 2016, his concerns became a reality when a series of forest fires raged across the Great Smokey Mountains National Park. In the aftermath, Grissino-Mayer became the go-to academic expert on the scene. He explained why this tragedy occurred and the potential for such a disaster to occur again. He spoke in straightforward terms and enabled people without a PhD or even a scientific background to understand the threats posted by this situation, their causes, and their human costs. Grissino-Mayer is most recognized for his work on dendrochronology and, given the trends in climate change and the constant tug-of-war between economic development and environmental concerns, his research is highly significant. His personal website is a virtual public clearinghouse for research and discussions on dendrochronology, which is further evidence of the importance of his work. Lorayne W. Lester Award Susan Martin, Department of Classics Professor Susan Martin   s career has embodied the very definition of university service. In addition to her faculty position in the classics department, Martin has served as department head in classics, associate dean for academic personnel in our college, senior vice provost, and provost and senior vice chancellor of academic affairs for the university. Under her leadership, she single-handedly and effectively advocated for the advancement of women to positions of power, and she focused on enhancing diversity well before our office of diversity and inclusion was ever established. She never forgot her home department, however, and when needed, taught classes while also maintaining her leadership duties at the campus level. She has served as chair of the advisory council to the Classical School Committee of the American Academy in Rome and as president of the Tennessee Foreign Language Teaching Association, an organization that awarded Martin with the Jacqueline Elliott Award for Service in Higher Education in 2003. She also is past president of the Classical Association of the Middle West and South. College Marshal Chuck Maland, Department of English Professor Chuck Maland is a    make things happen    kind of person. Our cinema studies program is a prime example of how Maland gets the ball rolling. When he first developed the interdisciplinary program with faculty from the College of Communication and Information and several departments in our college, it had a handful of minors. Over the years, it has grown to be one of the most popular IDP majors in our college with a highly engaged group of faculty. He was also a successful English department head while launching the Cinema Studies program. Maland is full of energy and ideas and takes that into every course and every advising session he has with his students. In addition to teaching, he is a highly regarded researcher with interdisciplinary interests in film studies and American literature, culture, and intellectual history. He most recent work is an edition of James Agee   s movie writings and contains     for the first time     all of the reviews and essays Agee wrote for Time magazine. His book constitutes the definitive collection of Agee   s movie reviews and criticism, putting not only Maland in the spotlight as an expert on one of Knoxville   s literary giants, but also the college and the university as a whole. Maland has an extensive list of honors and awards he has received over his career, including the Chancellor   s Alexander Prize for Excellence in Teaching in Research. He has been named a Lindsay Young Professor and currently holds the J. Douglas Bruce Chair of English. Maland serves on the editorial boards for Film Criticism and Film and History and remains very active in the Cinema Studies program.","link":"https:\/\/artsci.utk.edu\/dialogue\/faculty-honored-annual-banquet\/"},{"title":"Fall 2017 College of Arts &#038; Sciences Dean\u2019s List","content":"Fall 2017 College of Arts & Sciences Dean   s List STUDENT NAME HONOR MAJOR CONCENTRATION Abdulqader, Mira W.

I hope you had a relaxing winter break and enjoyed time with family, friends, and your community. For many of us, the New Year means setting resolutions such as getting healthy, reading more, eating less sugar, traveling more, etc. My personal goal is to get enough sleep every day, something I recommend we all do to sustain our energy and enthusiasm for all aspects of life. As a college, we continue to work on several important goals this year. At the top of my list are supporting opportunities for inclusive conversations within and about our community  developing infrastructure that will allow faculty in our departments to develop master   s and other distance education opportunities  and finding the resources needed to accommodate the growth in student numbers and changing research programs of faculty. The New Year also provides an opportunity to reflect on what we leave behind. Last month, while most of us were celebrating our students    successes and preparing to leave for the holidays, our campus community experienced a racist act that reflected ignorance and bigotry. My response, which I shared with you all, condemned the message of division and implied intolerance painted on the Rock. While I strongly support freedom of speech and expression, inflammatory messages with no means of response are unacceptable. It is more important than ever to promote civil discourse and compassion for people of all backgrounds and to be able to communicate those values to the world. The liberal arts education our students receive should equip them for this task. A liberal arts education also provides our students with skills that almost every employer values     communication, critical thinking, and willingness to embrace diversity. We are all aware of the emphasis our society puts on obtaining a professional degree. While these are important, we also need people trained to understand the human, cultural, and social aspects of our world. As we move into a more technologically driven world, the human component is still vitally important. A liberal arts education prepares students to collaborate with their professional counterparts or gain additional professional education to tackle today   s biggest social and technological challenges within their human context. Let   s take the opportunity of a new year to communicate the value of the liberal arts to our community. These include how to engage in civil discourse  how to understand and embrace diversity  and how to think critically about complex relationships in our society. Let   s use our intellectual energy to communicate these values to our students and our communities and demonstrate the impact a liberal arts education can have on the world.","link":"https:\/\/artsci.utk.edu\/dialogue\/new-year-new-opportunities\/"},{"title":"Enhancing Philanthropy at UT","content":"Enhancing Philanthropy at UT Our annual Big Orange Family Campaign is just around the corner and this year, the theme is    Together.    Beginning Monday, February 5, you have the opportunity to join UT faculty and staff in a month-long initiative to enhance philanthropy within the UT community. No amount is too small for this campaign. Our goal is to increase the number of faculty and staff who support the university, which in turn, inspires our alumni and friends to invest in UT. Over the past four years of this campaign, faculty and staff have increased employee giving across campus from 16 to 52 percent! Last year, your support during the campaign helped us meet our university goal of 52 percent participation with our college participation of 45 percent. This year the university goal is set for 54 percent participation. Will you help us meet our goal again this year? Keep an eye on your inbox between February 5 and March 2 for your opportunity to give back. Together we can be the Volunteer difference at UT.

Mariam Thalos comes to UT from the University of Utah where she was a professor of philosophy for 16 years. After earning her PhD from the University of Illinois at Chicago in 1993, she taught at the SUNY Buffalo for eight years before moving to Utah. In the past, she focused her  research on fundamental and persistent questions in and regarding the sciences, especially the physical, social, and decisional sciences, as well as on the relations among all disciplines. Her current research focus is the nature of human experience, the philosophical foundations of self-hood, and the nature of that reasoning that directly provides support to our human agency (philosophers call it practical reasoning). Thalos has won numerous distinguished scholarly prizes for her work and been funded by national and international funding bodies, including the NSF.

This semester, we are supporting three events that achieve this goal. PLAY it OUT is a one-semester pilot program that will use socially engaged performance pieces to model civil and inclusive social interactions. The project seeks to openly address issues related to bias and unconscious bias and provide models of communication between groups of people from different backgrounds. The Sexual Empowerment and Awareness at Tennessee (SEAT), a student-run organization on campus, strives to foster a comprehensive and academically informed conversation about sex, sexuality, and relationships with the purpose of educating the UT student body and the Knoxville community through innovative, collaborative, and entertaining programming and events. One of these events is the annual Sex Week, which takes place April 9     13, 2018. Learn more about the history of this annual weeklong series of events and stay tuned for the 2018 schedule. Finally, Wade Davis, a former NFL player and advocate for inclusion in American sports, will visit campus March 3     5 to speak to students, faculty, and staff. Davis played college football and signed with the Tennessee Titans in 2000, but was cut after the preseason. He made his professional debut in 2001 with the NFL Europe team, Berlin Thunder, and won the World Bowl IX title with the team. In 2012, Davis came out and publicly spoke about what it was like to be closeted and gay in the NFL. He is the director of professional sports outreach for the You Can Play project, as advocacy organization working to eradicated homophobia in professional sports. In this role, he develops curriculum, programming, training, and conversations focused on inclusion and diversity.","link":"https:\/\/artsci.utk.edu\/dialogue\/supporting-diversity-2018\/"},{"title":"A&#038;S in the News","content":"A&S in the News This section of Dialogue features a roundup of outside media coverage faculty in our college received, as well as additional news items from departments.

Every gift matters to the university, no matter the level of the gift. The campaign s success is based solely on participation, making it possible for every single employee to be a part of the program. When we give,  they    give. By  they   we are referring to the alumni and friends who support our work here at UT. The Big Orange Family Campaign is your opportunity to say that you have joined UT   s journey and want to show that support with your investment.   Your participation demonstrates that UT is one of the best possible investments for a potential donor s philanthropic support. Who gives through the Big Orange Family Campaign? Everyone who wants to! All full-time employees are invited to participate. Additionally, if you are UT alumni your gift to the campaign will also be counted in alumni participation rates. Can I give for someone else? No! Remember that it is not the level of someone   s gift, but their participation that counts. They can personally give a gift of any size that is meaningful to them and be considered a donor.   Are gifts tax-deductible? Yes! Your gift is considered by the IRS to be a charitable contribution and is 100 percent tax deductible. Please note, gifts to athletics for ticket benefits are not tax deductible. Does a team leader know if I   ve given? Your decision to participate in the campaign is personal, and we hope you will!   Your team leader will know if you have participated, but will not be provided giving amounts or other personal donor information.   How much should I give? Participation rates are how we measure our success. You can give $5, $50, $500 or more. What is important is that you get involved at a level that is meaningful to you. Where can I designate my gift? You can designate your gift to any college, department, program, scholarship, or pre-established gift fund.   I have already made a gift this year.   Does this count in the Big Orange Family Campaign? Yes, all gifts made by employees from July 1, 2017, to present will be counted. Can I make a gift jointly with my spouse or partner? Yes! Indicate on the gift card that the contribution is a joint gift and provide your spouse or partner s name. If they also work for the university, spouses and partners can count their gifts as joint or individual gifts. Spouses and partners who work off campus should check with their human resource office to determine if their company will match your gift. Complete the proper matching form and include it with your gift. What if I have an existing payroll deduction? Then you do not need to do anything, unless you would like to receive the Big Orange Family Campaign Tumbler.   Then, you will need to increase your monthly deduction amount by a minimum of $5 per month. Can I make a one-time gift through payroll deduction? Yes.   We have the capability to accept a one-time gift through payroll deduction.   Just indicate that on the gift form in the proper area. When will my payroll deduction start? If you are starting a new payroll deduction or made changes to your current payroll deduction, the new deduction will begin the following month. What about a deferred gift? Deferred gifts   such as gift annuities, charitable remainder trusts, and life insurance policies   also count as faculty and staff contributions.

He was 81. Riggsby, who received his PhD in molecular biology and biophysics from Yale University in 1964, joined the Volunteer family in 1969 as an assistant professor of microbiology. In 1987, he began his journey as a leader in the College of Arts and Sciences when he became associate head of the Department of Microbiology. A decade later, he stepped into the role of associate dean for the college and, by 2003, former Chancellor Loren Crabtree named Riggsby dean of the College of Arts and Sciences. Riggsby also served as director of the Tennessee Governor   s School for the Sciences from 1991 to 1994. He retired from the university in 2004 and left quite a legacy. Although Riggsby   s educational foundation was rooted in the hard sciences, he strongly believed in the value of the humanities. His interests ranged from the history of music and opera to the culture of the Mediterranean. Along with his wife Kate, their support established the Marco Institute for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, which hosts an annual Riggsby Lecture on Medieval Mediterranean History and Culture. Additionally, the Marco Institute   s Library and Reading Room and directorship carry the Riggsby name. In recent years, he also took a strong interest in the establishment of the Tennessee Humanities Center and avidly supported the Department of Theatre.    You can do an awful lot more supporting programs in the humanities than by supporting, with an equal amount of money, the sciences,    said Riggsby during a 2013 interview when he endowed a professorship in the Department of Theatre.    Stuart Riggsby was not just a generous supporter of Marco or the dean who played a key role in enabling our institute to become a permanent part of the university and a research center with an international reputation for excellence. Stuart was, for all of us, an inspiration,    says Jay Rubenstein, Riggsby Director of Marco.    His eyes lit up when presented with a new idea or a new historical vista. He encouraged our graduate students, and he set for all of us an unparalleled example.    Riggsby also loved food and cooking and was an avid chef. According to Professor Jeffrey Kovac, a long-time friend and colleague, Riggsby would go to the University Center Tuesdays and Wednesdays to buy a copy of the New York Times.    Tuesday   s paper has the science section and Wednesday   s paper has the food section,    Kovac says.    I would often encounter him at Kroger on Saturday doing his grocery shopping. He wrote his shopping lists on old IBM computer cards. His wife, Kate, had worked in the computer center and they must have had boxes of IBM cards.    Riggsby was a broad and deep thinker, genuine intellectual, and a gentleman in the old-fashioned sense. His legacy in the College of Arts and Sciences will impact generations of scholars. He continued to support the college and impact its success by serving on the Dean   s Advisory Board. He will be greatly missed. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that donations be made in his honor to the Marco Institute.","link":"https:\/\/artsci.utk.edu\/memoriam-stuart-riggsby\/"},{"title":"College of Arts and Sciences Ambassadors","content":"College of Arts and Sciences Ambassadors CAS Ambassadors serve for recruitment and education efforts with the College of Arts and Sciences.

Faculty in the Department of Sociology are integrating civic responsibility in their courses and exposing students to the impact they can have on their communities. The Association of American Colleges and Universities (AAC&U) selected 22 departments from institutions across the country that are providing models for how to make civic learning and democratic engagement an expectation for all students who major in that discipline. Not only did the UT Department of Sociology make the list, it was also one of nine departments selected as a featured case study in Peer Review, AAC&U   s quarterly publication on emerging trends and key debates in undergraduate education. The issue,    Civic Learning in the Major by Design,    was published in January 2018. Out of each of the nine programs, the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, is also the only research-intensive university to make the list.    This recognition aligns with our mission as a land-grant institution to make a real impact on the community surrounding us,    says Jon Shefner, professor and head of the sociology department. His article,    Civic Engagement in and out of the Sociology Classroom,    addresses the question  How do we as a department try to contribute in the current political, social, and environmental moment? Caryn McTighe Musil, senior scholar and director of Civic Learning and Democracy Initiatives and the Civic Learning in the Major by Design project, was impressed by the creativity and variety of ways that the selected departments used a civic lens to enhance the design of the major.    These civic-rich departmental designs seek to increase students    comprehension of their discipline   s investigations, enhance voice and agency, offer hands-on practice in collaboratively addressing challenging public problems,    McTighe Musil says.    They introduce students to moral, ethical, and civic responsibility issues that are likely to be part of their professional lives.

Hodges Library. The Echoes of War exhibit includes items showcasing the American experience during the World Wars.    This exhibit is a vivid demonstration of what happens when distinct parts of UT cooperate,    says Vejas Liulevicius, director of the Center for the Study of War and Society.    It is the result of a decades-long productive partnership between the Center for the Study of War and Society and the talented staff of UT Libraries Special Collections.    Among the objects on display from the UT Libraries    Special Collections are letters home from WWI soldiers, a WWI doughboy   s helmet, and a WWII soldier   s footlocker and Army-issued sewing kit. Digital images and artwork, along with excerpts from interviews with veterans recorded as part of the WWII Oral History Project, will complement the artifacts.    This exhibit masterfully shows how individual lives intersected with the World Wars and the huge waves of change those conflicts produced,    Liulevicius says.    The displays show how particular people s stories add up to the biggest events in modern history.    The exhibit includes a few original combat scene sketches drawn by a Knoxville child as he listened to radio broadcasts during WWII. That child was Hal Ernest, son of the owner of Ellis and Ernest Drugstore that stood on UT   s campus until 1967.    For me personally, what is most rewarding is the way in which the exhibit s artifacts connect to the history of UT at war, and our region, with photos of Oak Ridge or crowds celebrating the end of World War I on Gay Street,    says Liulevicius.    Another exciting piece is the exhibit aims to inspire UT students to think about what things they could research for a senior thesis or a research paper, using the amazing resources archived and available for use in the UT Libraries Special Collections.

Conversation themes include the following  Global Communities STEM in Arts and Sciences Social Justice Issues The Arts and Humanities Human Behavior Career Readiness (Life After UT) Experiential Learning (research, service learning courses, hands-on experiences) We are adding a new component to this year   s event     Engagement Discussions. We reserved a classroom for 15- to 20-minute discussions about topics that may be appealing to students. We are accepting proposals for engagement discussions on the following topics  involvement with research, career readiness, establishing mentorships with faculty, and graduate school preparation. Additional suggestions are also welcome. Each presentation will begin during the transition periods between classes. As this event continues to evolve, we look forward to more engagement with students in our college and the opportunity to recruit second majors and minors from other colleges. If you have any questions about Explore CAS, please email Jeff Elliot.","link":"https:\/\/artsci.utk.edu\/dialogue\/explore-cas-festival\/"},{"title":"Student Success","content":"Student Success Last week, we kicked off the Big Orange Family Campaign, a campus-wide initiative to enhance philanthropy among UT faculty and staff. For the next month, you will receive emails about the importance of giving back and inspiring others to give to UT. In our college, we saw this as an opportunity to launch a specific campaign dedicated to support the people we are here for     our students. Over the years, faculty and staff have shared stories about students who need some additional financial help in order to register for classes or purchase materials, such as clickers, required for a course, but could not find a source of funding. We hope to end those stories with this campaign. We launched a Student Emergency Fund to help any student majoring in the College of Arts and Sciences who finds themselves in an unforeseen financial emergency. With your support, we can fill a void in these students    lives and help them succeed. Please consider supporting this important initiative and sharing the giving opportunity with your friends and family. Together, we can help our students succeed.","link":"https:\/\/artsci.utk.edu\/dialogue\/student-success\/"},{"title":"Opportunities Abound","content":"Opportunities Abound Since the beginning of the year, it seems like every time we turn around we have an opportunity to engage in discourse about free speech on campus. As the spring semester moves along, I encourage you to continue in your efforts, both in and out of the classroom, to support diversity and inclusion at UT. We should support free speech while showing disapproval for hate speech in a peaceful and lawful manner. I hope that many of us can turn out for the pro-diversity civil discourse rallies and leave our external guest to speak to an empty room. This month, I also would like to address a couple of opportunities for our college. If you receive the UT Advocacy emails, you probably saw the notice about a bill filed January 30, 2018, by Rep. Tilman Goins. He proposes to require first-time college students at two- or four-year colleges and universities to take no more than six credit hours in the humanities in order to fulfill general education requirements. Goins also proposes to require first-time college students to take at least three credit hours of economics for general education requirements. My first reaction was to reach out to a legislator on the education committee who has been a friend to the college and find out how seriously we need to take this bill. I was told that the bill is unlikely to go far, but we need to be vigilant if it is picked up in the other legislative branch. As dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Tennessee   s flagship institution, I will address the value of the humanities and liberal arts in today   s world and refute the notion that classes in the humanities are unnecessary for a good education. My goal is to write editorials for local and state newspapers, focusing on recent publications about the value of liberal arts in a wide variety of career settings. A short list of those articles is included below. I welcome your thoughts and individual efforts to respond to this bill and to communicate the value of the education we provide here in the College of Arts and Sciences. Also, the National Humanities Alliance is hosting its annual meeting in Washington, D.C. in March, which includes a March 13 visit to Capitol Hill for Humanities Advocacy Day. We will have voices from our college in attendance. Another issue I want to address is the next round of cluster hires. The data science cluster hire, announced last fall, is on hold while further discussion occurs between UT and ORNL officials. The provost   s office, however, is seeking proposals for two other new clusters, which have no restrictions with regard to focus areas. The previous data science proposals can be resubmitted. Proposals are due by 5 p.m. March 21, so if you have ideas for a cluster hire, please submit a proposal. Although the colleges have not been asked to support or vet these proposals     I think it would be helpful to let your department heads and or Associate Dean Boake know about clusters involving CAS faculty. New hires involving CAS departments will ultimately require that departments and the college find appropriate space and likely other resources. It would be helpful to us and to the cluster proposers, I would think, to know that their plans could be supported    at home.    Thank you for your work and dedication to the college. If you have any questions or have any information you would like to share in the next edition of Dialogue, please email me. Sincerely, Theresa M. Lee Dean, College of Arts & Sciences 11 Reasons To Ignore The Haters And Major In The Humanities Economics With a Humanities Face Microsoft s president says liberal arts majors are necessary for the future of tech","link":"https:\/\/artsci.utk.edu\/dialogue\/opportunities-abound\/"},{"title":"Explore CAS Festival","content":"Explore CAS Festival Tuesday, March 6, 2018 10 AM to 3 PM Hodges Library Whether you are a major in the College of Arts and Sciences looking for more information about what you can do with your future or a major in another college looking for a minor, this event is designed for students to explore the variety of major and minor fields of study the College of Arts and Sciences has to offer. This year, students will have the opportunity to engage with faculty, staff, and other students via    conversation stations    about relevant topics covering the breadth and depth of study within the college. Conversation themes include  Global Communities STEM in Arts and Sciences Social Justice Issues The Arts and Humanities Human Behavior Career Readiness (Life After UT) Experiential Learning (research, service learning courses, hands-on experiences) And more!

Provost Search I am on the search committee for a new provost and senior vice chancellor for the university. As the chief academic officer for our campus, this is a very important role that requires an innovative mindset and collaborative style vital for advancing academic success. As part of the interview process, each candidate participates in an open forum. The first forum for our Interim Provost John Zomchick took place March 6. Open forums for the remaining candidates will take place over the next couple of weeks. I hope you make time to attend these sessions, hear what they have to say about their vision for our campus, and submit your feedback via the online feedback form.   The schedule for candidate forums is as follows  Kimberly Andrews Espy Tuesday, March 20 3 to 4 PM Lindsay Young Auditorium, Hodges Library David C. Manderscheid Thursday, March 29 3 to 4 PM Lindsay Young Auditorium, Hodges Library More information about the search and candidate application materials are available on the HR website. Tenure Performance Review Policy Proposed changes to the Enhanced Post-tenure Performance Review (EPPR) Policy will be presented for consideration at the UT Board of Trustees meeting March 23 in Memphis. While President DiPietro supports the new policy, nearly 80 percent of faculty oppose the new policy, according to a survey conducted by the Faculty Senate. Members of the Board of Trustees recently added new language to the policy giving themselves power to initiate    comprehensive peer reviews    of faculty members every six years as well as faculty members in    underperforming departments.    I encourage you to learn more about the proposed policy on the Faculty Senate website. FOCUS Act Update In February, outgoing Governor Bill Haslam proposed a restructuring of the UT Board of Trustees, which would reduce the number of members on the board. The plan is laid out in the UT FOCUS Act, sponsored by Sen. Mark Norris and Rep. David Hawk. The bill will be voted on by members of the Finance, Ways, and Means Committee March 20 and by members of the Senate Education Committee March 21. The UT Advocacy website has more information and updates about the progress of this bill. We have a lot on our plates this spring. I hope you take time to learn about and engage with these issues that affect our campus community. One way to do so is to join the faculty senate for discussion at the Torchbearer at noon on March 20. As always, if you have any questions, please email me. Thanks for your work in the college!

Lee Dean, College of Arts & Sciences","link":"https:\/\/artsci.utk.edu\/dialogue\/a-busy-spring\/"},{"title":"Humanities Center Fellows","content":"Humanities Center Fellows The UT Humanities Center (UTHC) is proud to announce its fellowship class of 2018-19. The UTHC offers fellowships for faculty and graduate students in its nine affiliated departments. Fellows spend one year as residents in the Humanities Center to work full-time on their research projects, which may be scholarly books, digital humanities projects, or significant editorial work. The fellowship program was modeled on those at the most prestigious institutions in the United States and is vital to supporting complex and cutting-edge humanities research because it gives faculty time to do immersive reading for a project, to travel to archives and exhibitions, and to write.    The program offers many benefits to the university,    says Amy Elias, UTHC director.    In addition to increasing faculty publication, it is key to increasing external grant applications, since one of our requirements is that all applicants must also apply for external funding. Because the fellowship applications are externally reviewed, the program advertises to other universities the stellar work done by UT humanities scholars. The fellowship program puts UT in the company of the best research universities.    UTHC Fellows also engage in weekly presentations of their work, attend lectures by distinguished visiting faculty, and engage in activities related to the humanities community.  My time at the UTHC has enriched my research immeasurably,    says Justin Arft, assistant professor in the Department of Classics and a 2017-18 faculty fellow.    Research and writing at a professional level is a learned skill, and under normal circumstances we all do it at fever-pitch. This full year at the UTHC has taught me what the process of scholarly inquiry can be, a lesson that will inform all of my work in the future.    UT Humanities Center Fellows for the 2018-19 academic year are as follows  Faculty Fellows Nuria Cruz C  mara, Professor, Department of Modern Foreign Languages and Literatures Project Title    Constructing the Spanish Modern Woman, 1928-1938  The Magazines Estampa and Cr  nica Gina Di Salvo, Assistant Professor, Department of Theatre Project Title    The Theatrical Life of the Saints  English Performance from the Middle Ages to Shakespeare Nicole Eggers, Assistant Professor, Department of History Project Title  Kitawala in the Congo  Power, Prayer, and the Politics of Health Mary McAlpin, Professor, Department of Modern Foreign Languages and Literatures Project Title    Rationalizing Rape  Nature, History, and Sexual Violence in the French Enlightenment Urmila Seshagiri, Associate Professor, Department of English Project Title    Virginia Woolf   s    A Sketch of the Past     The First Scholarly Edition Helene Sinnreich, Associate Professor, Department of Religious Studies Project Title    Who Shall Live and Who Shall Die?

Of these, 110 were UT   s top-ranking juniors and seniors. Representing academic disciplines across the natural sciences, social sciences, arts, and humanities, they had an average GPA of 3.9. The 111th new member was Theresa M. Lee, dean of the College of Arts and Sciences. Members of the UT Phi Beta Kappa recognized Dean Lee for her outstanding scholarship in the field of biopsychology and stellar leadership of the College of Arts and Sciences. Former UT Chancellor Beverly Davenport and Frederick Lawrence, secretary and CEO of the Phi Beta Kappa Society, participated in the induction, making the evening especially memorable for the inductees and their guests. Founded in 1776, Phi Beta Kappa is the nation   s oldest academic honor society with chapters at 286 colleges and universities and more than half a million members throughout the country. Its mission is to champion the liberal arts and sciences, to recognize academic excellence, and to foster freedom of thought and expression. Only about 10 percent of the nation   s four-year colleges and universities have the honor of hosting a Phi Beta Kappa chapter. Approximately 10 percent of the graduates of those institutions are invited each year to become members, based on a rigorous academic selection process that takes into account both grades and breadth of coursework across the arts and sciences. UT   s chapter of Phi Beta Kappa was installed May 18, 1965, when the first 24 undergraduates were inducted.","link":"https:\/\/artsci.utk.edu\/dialogue\/phi-beta-kappa-honors-dean-lee\/"},{"title":"Outstanding Academic Support","content":"Outstanding Academic Support Donna Bodenheimer, administrative specialist and secretary to the associate head in the Department of English, received the Outstanding Academic Support award.

Greetings! I hope you all had a good summer and were able to enjoy some well-deserved downtime. From record first year enrollment in our arts and humanities programs to the opening of another state-of-the-art science building, we have several exciting things on the horizon for this academic year. First, I want to welcome the many new faculty and staff to our college and the UT campus. I look forward to working with you! I would also like to congratulate the newly tenured and promoted faculty, new department heads, and new IDP chairs on your positions. I am grateful for the added responsibilities you will take up this year. Please save the date for our Mossman grand opening the afternoon of Friday, September 21. All faculty and staff in the college are welcome to join us for a short program and light refreshments. Congratulations to all faculty and staff in the arts and humanities for your growth in majors this fall. According to a UT admissions report for May 22, 2018, on students who have confirmed they plan to start classes at UT in the fall, eight of the top nine majors in our college are from the arts and humanities. Collectively, this group grew from 159 majors in 2017 to 257 majors in 2018     a 61.6 percent growth. Of those, the Departments of Philosophy and Classics had the largest percentage increase. In other good news, the college had a record-breaking fundraising year of more than $21 million from 5,678 donors. These donors include our own faculty and staff     and I thank you for your support of the college and university! UT also had a record-breaking fundraising year across the university for fiscal year 2018 with more than 46,000 donors providing $235 million in gifts and pledges. Additionally, we have surpassed the $1 billion mark in the Join the Journey campaign. We continue to implement Advising 2020, which will result in professional advisors assigned to each department in the college. Moving forward, advising staff will help our students explore their goals and interests and provide them with the tools they need to develop and implement a plan for graduation. In this new model, faculty will become mentors, help students explore experiential opportunities related to the discipline, and provide advice about career opportunities, among other mentoring roles. At the college level, we are rolling out two student ambassador programs     one for recruitment and one for social media engagement. Advising staff are working with 11 students who applied to be part of the first College of Arts and Sciences Student Ambassador program. These students will represent the college at recruitment events and other outreach opportunities. Our communications team will train and provide guidance for students recruited by faculty and staff for the Social Media Ambassador program in order to increase engagement opportunities on a variety of social media platforms. One of my goals this academic year is to visit each department. In addition to sharing some administrative updates, I want to hear from you. What challenges do you face and how can we work together to solve them? What concerns you? Thank you for all you do for the college. As always, if you have any questions or comments to share with me, or if you have some good news you want to pass along, please send me an email. Sincerely, Theresa M. Lee Dean, College of Arts & Sciences","link":"https:\/\/artsci.utk.edu\/dialogue\/welcome-back\/"},{"title":"Cyber Security","content":"Cyber Security We live in an increasingly connected world. Each day, we interact online through emails, file storage, social media, etc., which is why cyber security is extremely important and a focus of discussion on the Knoxville campus. This semester, Dean Lee will visit each department to discuss new policy and procedures about systems and information security management. The goal is to protect information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. Information security management is a process of defining the security controls in order to protect IT resources at UT. Each department with a system     servers, software, networks, databases     will need to develop a system security plan and implement controls to safeguard IT resources. During her visit, Dean Lee will discuss what data needs to be secured if located on a system, collecting information about who is in control of system information, and how to make sure the security in place is sufficient. Please note, this is different from the classification process for workstations and laptops. System security plans are for critical systems vital to a unit   s ability to operate. You can find out more about the UT Information Security Methodology at security.utk.edu. Also, a quick reminder that if you take your personal security awareness training by August 31, you will be invited to join Dean Lee and other college faculty and staff for an ice cream social.

Research on first-year student retention supports early identification intervention programs as high impact activities that positively affect student success. The Early Alert system is an outreach program designed for early detection and intervention of students exhibiting signs of academic distress. The system utilizes a campus-wide coaching advising and tutoring information system (GradesFirst) to allow faculty to report student progress or distress. Faculty reports are viewable by academic coaches and enable staff in the office of First-Year Studies to collaborate with other academic success departments in determining the best possible success intervention.    At a large university like UT, it is easy for students to think that no one notices,    says Karen Sullivan-Vance, associate vice provost for student success.    We know that all students face challenges at some point in their university studies, but having equitable support to meet the challenge can be the deciding factor in a student learning from the event, persisting, and moving on to graduation. Early alerts offer an opportunity for us to intervene right at the point when a student begins to struggle.    Faculty can do a great deal to make UT a better institution by providing feedback on student engagement and performance early in the term. Personal Contact  Request to meet with students who are missing class, not completing homework or doing poorly on assignments, quizzes, and exams. Early Alert Request  Participate in once a semester requests for feedback on student progress. Student feedback provided by faculty through GradesFirst is available to academic success staff and students for action. Email First-Year Studies  Email staff in the office anytime with questions about the process or GradesFirst at firstyear@utk.edu. Staff are devoted to ensuring a smooth transition and a successful experience for all students in their first year at the UT. Refer to academic coach  Encourage students to make an appointment with an academic coach in the Student Success Center. How to schedule an academic coaching appointment.    Every time faculty send an early alert referral to us, they are making a positive difference in the student s life,    Sullivan-Vance says.    Any time faculty want to talk about the early alert process and have a coffee on me, I ll meet them on campus and buy them one as a thank you!

The Mossmans are like fairy godparents to this place,    UT System President Joe DiPietro said during the building   s ribbon-cutting ceremony. Ken and Blaire Mossman met in Knoxville in 1968 while pursuing their degrees at UT. Ken Mossman earned his master   s and doctoral degrees in health physics and radiation biology through the Institute of Radiation Biology, a joint program of UT and Oak Ridge National Laboratory, in 1970 and 1973, respectively. He went on to teach at the university level for 40 years. In 2013, President Barack Obama appointed him to serve on the US Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board. Blaire Mossman earned a bachelor   s degree in French from UT in 1971. She spent 30 years as a science and technology publications editor and worked for the National Biomedical Research Foundation.    The Mossmans wished to highlight the wonder and discovery of science and share it with our campus and surrounding community, so when it came time to name the building, we thought it would only be fitting to honor the legacy of Ken and Blaire Mossman to thank them for their endless generosity,    Interim Chancellor Wayne T. Davis said during the ceremony.    One highlight of the building for me is the student gathering space on various floors. If Ken and Blaire had not met in a student gathering space on campus all those years ago, we would not be sitting here today celebrating their legacy.    The gathering spaces in the building will allow students, faculty, and staff to come together to collaborate and innovate. The classrooms and laboratories will give students hands-on experience to prepare them for future careers in their chosen fields.    The cafe will provide the much-needed caffeine to get them through finals,    Davis added.    Whether it   s the people or the facilities, this campus changes lives in so many ways. The feeling you get when you walk on this campus is like none other. Ken and Blaire never forgot that feeling. It is only fitting that we honor their memory today.    Blaire Mossman died of brain cancer in 2011 at age 60  Ken Mossman died suddenly in 2014 at age 67. Their contributions to the university, which included an estate gift, fund the Kenneth and Blaire Mossman Professorship in the College of Arts and Sciences and study abroad scholarships for undergraduate students in the Romance languages. Their gift also funds the annual Mossman Lecture, which brings nationally recognized speakers to campus to promote interest in science among youth. The Mossman Building is a 221,000-square-foot, six-floor facility that houses microbiology, biochemistry, cellular and molecular biology, psychology, and nutrition. It features interactive classrooms, laboratories, and ample gathering spaces and study areas. Jay Whelan, head of the Department of Nutrition, said during his ribbon-cutting remarks that the state-of-the art facilities will help recruit and retain world-class students and faculty and propel research activities, all of which will help attract important funding for continued work.    The Ken and Blaire Mossman Building is an amazing state-of-the-art structure that communicates to visitors, whether they are faculty or undergraduate students, that UT conducts cutting-edge research and that those lucky enough to be in this building are part of this endeavor,    Gladys Alexandre, head of the Department of Biochemistry and Cellular and Molecular Biology, said during the ceremony. Michael Mossman, brother of Ken Mossman, said his brother and sister-in-law loved UT and would have reveled in what their donations have done to enhance the campus.    Ken was an educator at heart,    he said.    My brother believed teachers don   t just teach, they create the environment where students learn. He would be so very, very proud of this building.    A commitment to higher education and biomedical research drove their philanthropic endeavors at UT. The Mossmans were also strong believers in the value of a liberal arts education and served as members of the College of Arts and Sciences Dean   s Advisory Board.    The gifts from Ken and Blaire are making a transformative impact on our college and our university,    said Theresa Lee, dean of the College of Arts and Sciences.    This building, named in honor of their memory, celebrates their long history with UT and their passion for international experiences and biology and science education.    The Mossmans truly embodied the Volunteer Spirit in giving back. Their generosity will impact UT students and faculty for generations.","link":"https:\/\/artsci.utk.edu\/dialogue\/remembering-the-mossmans\/"},{"title":"Honoring College Alumni","content":"Honoring College Alumni We hosted our annual College of Arts and Sciences Alumni and Philanthropy Awards celebration Friday, September 21 and honored several alumni for their professional achievements and philanthropic endeavors. The Divisional Achievement Award recognizes rising stars who exhibit exceptional talent and promise in the early to middle stages of their careers. Alumni from each of the four disciplines in our college are eligible for nomination. This year, we recognized two recipients. Peter Knappett received the Achievement in Natural Sciences award and Clayton McDonald received the Achievement in Humanities award. Peter Knappett earned a PhD in geology in 2010. After graduating, he received a prestigious Marie Curie Postdoctoral Research Fellowship at the Hemholtz Center for Environmental Health from 2010-11 in Munich, Germany, and from 2012-13, took another postdoctoral position at the Columbia University Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. He is an assistant professor at Texas A&M University with plans to submit his tenure dossier this fall. Knappett   s research focuses on microbial contaminants and arsenic in alluvial aquifers in Bangladesh, Mexico, and the Southeastern United States. His accomplishments include 31 peer-reviewed journal articles, $430,000 in research grants, and advisor to a dozen graduate students. He also received the 2014 Kohut Early Career Award from the Hydrogeology Division of the Geological Society of America. Knappett collaborates with faculty in the UT Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, hosts speakers, and supports EPS with regular monetary contributions. In 2000, Clayton McDonald graduated from the Language and World Business Program with a concentration in Spanish. Today, he is the head of global Sales for INTL FCStone, Inc., a publicly held financial services firm specializing in international currency trading in the developing world. He is one of the most active LWB alumni who returns to campus each year to guest lecture and attend poster presentations. His interactions with our students help them envision a career with a degree in Spanish. One student commented,    I had always viewed as being paid to travel as an aspiration I could only dream of, but after hearing from Mr. McDonald, it is now a goal that is more in reach.    In 2015, he established the Clayton McDonald Undergraduate Travel Abroad Scholarship for LWB students. McDonald began his career as a trader at INTL FCStone and worked his way up to his current position. His success reflects the message we try to get across about a degree in the humanities     it can lead to a successful and productive career anywhere in the world because the ability to communication in any language will always be a significant key to success. The Scholarly and Creative Achievement Award recognizes alumni who have achieved a high degree of success in their chosen field in either a scholarly or creative endeavor. The trademark of this recipient is a record of notable accomplishments and a history of outstanding contributions to their discipline and or creative pursuits. This year, we recognize Wanda Rushing with the Scholarly Achievement award and Alan Gratz with the Creative Achievement award. Wanda Rushing earned her PhD in sociology in 1998. She is Professor Emerita of Sociology at the University of Memphis and the author of Memphis and the Paradox of Space  Globalization in the American South. Rushing   s scholarship focuses on the political economy of development, racial and social inequality, education and economic development in the South, and urban change. Her work continues to question popular assumptions about the South. In recent research on feminism and intersectionality, Rushing encourages scholars and activists to broaden their concept of intersectionality to include place, region, and locale as well as gender, race, and sexuality in an effort to explain the existence and persistence of social inequality better. She is the former president of Sociologists for Women Society and continues to publish her work in prestigious venues, presents at academic conferences, and remains a force in the discipline despite her recent retirement. In 2014, Rushing established the Dr. Wanda Rushing Sociological Research Excellence Endowment in Sociology to recognize outstanding faculty and graduate students for research efforts. Alan Gratz is a 1993 graduate of the College Scholars Program with an emphasis in creative writing and a highly successful full-time writer of young adult fiction. Since 2006, he has published 14 novels, short stories, plays, and television scripts. Gratz has created a body of work that inspires young people to read. Some of his books, such as Samurai Shortstop, are just fun and will lure the sports crazy boy to put down his glove and pick up a book. Others, such as Something Rotten, are a path into great literature, in this case Shakespeare. Recent books, Refugee and Ban This Book introduce important social issues. Gratz has received several prestigious awards for his work. His more recent novel, Refugee, was on the New York Times Bestseller list for more than three months and won numerous awards, including the Sidney Taylor Book Award for Older Readers and the NCTE Charlotte Huck Award for Outstanding Fiction for Children. The Professional Achievement Award recognizes alumni who have achieved a high degree of success in their chosen field, notable career accomplishments, and a history of outstanding contributions to their profession. This year, we recognized Ganapathy Shanmugam with this award. Ganapathy Shanmugam earned his PhD in geology in 1978. He has had a remarkable career, which included 22 years as a petroleum research geologist with Mobil Oil, followed by independent consulting and research and teaching at the University of Texas, Arlington. He helped redefine the understanding of deep-water sedimentary deposits and their role as oil reservoirs in the industry, a subject he has published extensively on throughout his career. Of the more than 130 peer-reviewed research articles, one of his papers (Shanmugam, 1996, J. Sed. Research) was the most highly cited paper in three journals in his field for a seven-year period and another paper (Shanmugam et al., 2009, J. Sed. Research) was listed by Web of Science as one of the most cited papers in this field over a five-year period after publication. In 2018, Shan received the Tamil American Pioneer Award of extraordinary professional achievements in academia from the Federation of Tamil Sangams of North America. The Volunteer Service Award recognizes exception service or long-term, continuing service to the college or a department or program within the college. With this award, we recognize alumni or friends who have dedicated a significant amount of time and talent to the college. This year we presented the Volunteer Service award to William C. Penley. Charlie Penley graduated from UT with a degree in microbiology in 1978. He received his medical degree from Wake Forest and achieved a high level of professional success through his career as an oncologist. He served his profession by volunteering for American Society of Clinical Oncology including, the chair of the Clinical Practice committee, Government Relations committee, and Conquer Cancer Foundation. He also serves on the Board of Trustees of the Association of Community Cancer Centers. Penley   s contributions to the College of Arts and Sciences include being a member of the Dean   s Advisory Board since 2007, chair from 2014-16, and serving on the search committee for the executive director of development in 2015. His nonprofit experience helped guide the advisory board   s response to issues facing the university, such as legislative advocacy and achieving Top 25 benchmarks. Finally, He and his wife Connally established the Penley Fund for Graduate Studies in Arts and Sciences in 2008, which provides graduate student awards in any discipline within the college in order to attract top quality graduate students to our programs. The College of Arts and Sciences Philanthropist Award recognizes exceptional generosity and impact of a philanthropist on the college. Several people we recognize with alumni awards provide philanthropic support to the college, but we designed this award specifically to acknowledge an individual whose philanthropy has made a significant difference to the college over a significant amount of time. This year, we recognized Judi Herbert for her vision and philanthropic support of our college. Judi Herbert graduated from UT in 1963 with a degree in English. She has been an advocate ever since. As a member of the Dean   s Advisory Board, she is helping UT take transformational strides towards creating a comprehensive Writing Center that offers an extensive array of writing support to students and faculty. Herbert and her husband Jim played a major role in the 2017 Big Orange Give campaign, successfully challenging the UT community to raise more than $1.5 million by offering a challenge gift for the Writing Center. Her gift was key to establishing a new undergraduate peer tutoring program, providing more one-to-one tutoring help for students writing in upper-division courses, and to launching a new Writing Center service     help for students preparing application materials, such as cover letters for jobs, resumes, and personal statements. The gift also helps provide more support for faculty teaching courses with writing across disciplines by establishing a new summer workshop. With her help, we are enhancing our ability to ensure all students graduate the University of Tennessee, Knoxville with excellent writing skills. The final award during the ceremony is the Dean   s Distinguished Alumnus Alumna Award, which recognizes an outstanding alumnus alumna of the college who has attained extraordinary distinction through a lifetime record of achievement and service. This year, we recognized Don Denbo. Don Denbo graduated with a degree in psychology and a minor in history from UT in 1971 and went on to earn his PhD in economics from the London School of Economics. Denbo served as the founder and principal of Commercial Insurance Associates, LLC. He is highly regarded among his peers in the commercial insurance industry with 40 years of business experience and more than 30 years of success specifically in the insurance field. His leadership extends from the insurance field into several other areas, including the owner of Denbo Metal Recovery and director of Tennessee Valley Recycling, LLC, Bancroft Technology Group, Jet Plex Associates, Shadowbluff Development, Reid Hill, and Greymont Kennels, LLC.

Originally from Texas, Haswell received his BA in music from UT with a concentration in studio music and jazz guitar. While completing his degree, Haswell spent two years working for the main business office in the Office of Information and Technology.    My supervisor at the time encouraged me to apply into UT   s temporary help pool because that was how she got her foot in the door at UT,    Haswell says.    She assured me that my dedication to learning IRIS and my work ethic would help me find somewhere viable to grow into.    Haswell ended up in the sponsored projects accounting group, which manages the accounting for externally funded projects     a job he knew virtually nothing about at the time.    I spent the next two years asking more questions than people probably cared to answer and ultimately was able to co-present several training sessions regarding post-award finance issues,    Haswell says.    With this increased visibility, the Office of Research and Engagement eventually recruited me into their Office of Sponsored Programs office to serve as a proposal coordinator where I was able to continue learning the nuts-and-bolts of research administration.    He joined the college in at the end of the 2017 spring semester as research coordinator, working for the associate dean for research and facilities. In this role, he reviews external funding requests for compliance, manages arts and sciences research incentive funding, generates research-related activity reports for the college and departments, and coordinates the annual space inventory for arts and sciences administration managed facilities.    Being involved in the wide breadth of research and scholarly activities that occur in the College of Arts and Sciences is my favorite thing about my job,    Haswell says.    From the natural and social sciences to the humanities and performing visual arts, we have such a diverse group of faculty, staff, and students. It is truly a privilege to be able to interact with all of these brilliant people and do my part to help them achieve funding for their incredible ideas.    When he is not on the third floor of Ayres Hall, Haswell is hiking, biking, climbing, and enjoying the outdoors. He is a passionate musician who loves collecting vinyl records and going to see live music, stand-up comedy, and art shows. He is also passionate about photography and says being a photographer is his dream job.    I get a twinkle in my eye when I think about pursuing photography as a profession,    Haswell says.    I spend as much of my free time as I can wandering through the beautiful wilderness of East Tennessee. I love capturing the perfect frame of the mountains, waterfalls, and the diversity of wildlife     I love finding salamanders! A picture really can say a thousand words and invoke a thousand feelings, and I love to preserve the memories and share them with my friends and family.    Haswell is deeply grateful to the University of Tennessee, Knoxville for the opportunities he has had during his academic career and current job as research coordinator.    We have an incredibly strong community and culture here,    Haswell says.    I have learned so many things from some truly great mentors   from studying jazz music with living jazz legends, to studying campus policy with our lead administrators, and studying research administration with real-deal rock star scientists and professionals. I enjoy serving the greater UT community and helping as many people as I can, and I look forward to many more years and connections at UT.

Dean Theresa Lee, associate deans, and directors recognized faculty from across the college for their teaching, research, creative activity, advising, and leadership in diversity efforts, as well as name the College Marshal, the highest honor for the college. Knoxville Poet Laureate and Professor Emerita Marilyn Kallet opened the ceremony with a poem titled    How to Reply to a Major General,    a love poem for the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, which she wrote in response to the question,    How did you end up in Knoxville?    Jioni Lewis, assistant professor in the Department of Psychology, received the first award of the night for her passion and commitment to diversity issues. The Diversity Leadership Award recognizes the extraordinary efforts of a staff or faculty member of the College of Arts and Sciences to support the college and university   s commitments to diversity. Lewis has provided education to students, staff, faculty, and administrators in the larger campus community about microaggressions in higher education by presenting and facilitating workshops and presentations across campus. She has served on several diversity-related committees at the department, college, and university levels including the Psychology Diversity Council, the College Strategic Planning Committee, the Commission for Blacks, and the Chancellor s Council for Diversity and Interculturalism. Professor Lewis also teaches courses at the undergraduate and graduate levels pertaining to multicultural and social justice issues. Finally, she focuses her research on diversity-related issues and mentors many diverse undergraduate and graduate students in her lab to train them to become teachers, researchers, and professionals in a diverse world.    In sum, Dr. Jioni Lewis provides the UT community with exceptional leadership, guidance, vision, and activism as part of her commitment to diversity,    said Angie Batey, associate dean for diversity.    She has inspired her faculty colleagues and many students through her scholarship, practice, training, and leadership roles, as well as through the many personal and mentoring relationships she has established.    Missy Parker, director of advising for the college, presented the Faculty Advising Service Awards, which recognize two faculty members for their excellence in undergraduate advising.    This recognition provides rewards for past achievement and encourages future resourceful and creative efforts in departmental advising,    Parker said. Alison Buchan, Carolyn W. Fite Professor of Microbiology, received an award for her leadership in the coordination of advising within the Department of Microbiology. Professor Buchan serves as an excellent advisor to her caseload of students. She has also facilitated and improved the quality of advising throughout the department. She consistently anticipates complications students may face when changes are made in general education, the microbiology concentration, and even courses in other departments. She has proactively worked to create equitable solutions that ensure microbiology students are not delayed in graduation and has allowed the faculty to focus more on career and graduate school discussions.    As the college moves toward full implementation of Advising 2020 with faculty serving in mentor roles, Dr. Buchan has already initiated discussions with the microbiology   s faculty advisors to determine what their priorities will be when they meet with students and how they will maintain interactions and relationships with advisees to complement, not compete with, their professional advisors,    Parker said.    Dr. Buchan   s dedication to advising and mentoring continues to have a positive impact on the Department of Microbiology and the experience of its students.    Jim Hall, associate professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Cellular & Molecular Biology, received an award for his work with students in BCMB as well as his extraordinary commitment to the students in neuroscience.    Jim has been an indispensable leader of the neuroscience major since its inception,    stated one of his nominators. In the five years since neuroscience was first offered as an interdisciplinary studies concentration, the program has grown to more than 400 majors. Jim Hall currently advises 140 them.    What is truly remarkable are the lengths to which he goes to provide each of these students with a meaningful experience,    Parker said.    In the words of a colleague,    Jim   s knowledge regarding the constantly shifting undergraduate university, college, and departmental requirements is encyclopedic. His down-to-earth style interactions with the students makes them feel valued and lets them know they have someone they can turn to if there are problems.    Professor Hall has also served as a resource to faculty who are advising neuroscience and BCMB students. He trains new faculty advisors and provides them the tools they need to mentor students effectively within both majors.    He was prepared to see my college career all the way through and knew so much about me as a student before I ever sat down with him,    stated one of his advisees. Professor Hall   s commitment to advising embodies his mantra     Students should be the primary focus of the university and therefore, the primary focus of the faculty.    Associate Dean for Research and Facilities Christine Boake presented awards for research and creative activity, which recognize faculty excellence in research and creative achievement at three levels     early career, mid-career, and senior career     and a distinguished research career at UT. Matt Buehler, assistant professor of political science, and Tore Olsson, assistant professor of history, received Early Career Excellence in Research and Creative Activity Awards. In his five years in the Department of Political Science, Professor Buehler has put together a distinguished resume. He came to UT after a prestigious post-doc and hit the ground running. He has published seven articles, many in top journals in his field. In addition, he has published three chapters in edited volumes. His crowning achievement, to this point, is a book manuscript at a top university press in the field. His success and increasing visibility in the discipline has resulted in other recognitions. He was invited to become a Research Fellow at  Harvard University   s Kennedy School of Government,  in the  Belfer  Center for Science & International Affairs,  as part of the  Middle East Initiative.    He is an excellent and gifted teacher,    Boake said.    In a department that prides itself on strong teaching, he is one of the best. He has been successful in attracting grants for his research and his teaching.    Trained as a historian of the American South, Professor Olsson   s research contributes to an important new direction in the field of American history, work that looks beyond the limits of national borders to trace the flow of ideas, goods, and people across political boundaries. Last year, Princeton University Press published his book, Agrarian Crossings  Remaking the U.S. and Mexican Countryside in the Twentieth Century. His research has been recognized with a remarkable string of accolades   three dissertation awards, several prizes for best journal article, and an NEH fellowship, among the most competitive in all fields of the humanities. Most historians hope to make a significant contribution to the scholarly conversation in one major field, but Tore   s work has been published and awarded in several sub-disciplines.    The range of his work is best shown by the fact that this year his book received three book prizes   it was judged to be the best book last year in the fields of American foreign relations, Latin American history, and agricultural history,    Boake said.    A remarkable recognition for a scholar at any stage of career.    Jessica Hay, associate professor of psychology, and Brandon Matheny, associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, received Mid-Career Excellence in Research and Creative Activity Awards. Professor Hay   s research program broadly focuses on language acquisition. Hay seeks to understand how infants    cognitive and perceptual systems allow them to learn so much about language so quickly, especially given that natural language is so complex. To gain this understanding, she studies children across early development, from preverbal infants to young children just learning to string words together and manipulates the complexity of the learning environment in the lab to simulate real world learning challenges faced by infants. Her methodological work suggests that even before infants can talk they begin learning the language around them by picking up on regularities in their environment. Using behavioral methodologies, Hay has found that this ability to detect statistical regularities, referred to as statistical learning, not only helps infants find words in continuous speech, but also helps them to make the mapping between words and meanings. Her research program has been almost continually funded by NIH since 2008 and is widely cited in the field of developmental psychology. Professor Matheny has compiled an outstanding record of research in the field of fungal biology. He has been involved in collaborative studies that produced a synthesis of overall fungal diversity in Australia, South America, and locally in the Smokies. His work on plant root-associated fungi helped to show that this syndrome has evolved multiple times and in multiple places. He has described more than 100 new species and multiple new genera and documented that post-burn fungi in the Smoky Mountains are not simply opportunists, but rather fungal symbionts that colonize burned areas from surviving vegetation and lichens. He has integrated both undergraduate and graduate students into his research, and has been active in sharing his expertise with the public. His research has been funded by multiple major grants, documented in almost 100 publications, and honored by the prestigious Fellows Award from the Mycological Society of America. Erin Hardin, professor of psychology, and Heather Hirschfeld, professor of English, received Senior Career Excellence in Research and Creative Activity Awards. Professor Hardin   s research program focuses on the empirical investigation of effective teaching practices as well as on projects that combine research and theory from basic and applied research to address pressing contemporary issues pertaining to career development. She is currently implementing an NIH-funded career education intervention in multiple rural Appalachian high schools aimed at reducing perceived educational barriers, facilitating career exploration, and encouraging engagement in STEMM. To extend the impact of this intervention study, Hardin and her colleagues obtained additional funding to provide job coaching and career counseling to adults in the same Appalachian communities. She is also conducting a study funded by NSF that provides undergraduate scholarships and support to facilitate success of low-income rural Appalachian students in Tennessee. Hardin is a member of the UT team that was recently awarded an NSF ADVANCE grant designed to increase the participation and advancement of women in academic STEM careers.    Dr. Hardin   s research program clearly is highly regarded and aimed at making a meaningful difference in our community,    Boake said. Professor Hirschfeld is an internationally recognized specialist in Shakespearean and non-Shakespearean English Renaissance drama. She is the author of two important monographs   as well as 24 articles and essays in prestigious edited collections. Recently, Hirschfeld has completed two major projects, which are being published by the two most important presses in her field. She is the editor of the just-published 34-chapter  Oxford Handbook of Shakespearean Comedy  to which she also contributed the introduction. She has also produced a revised edition of the New Cambridge Shakespeare  Hamlet. Her contributions to this volume include a 35,000-word introduction.    The fact that she was able to complete these two volumes simultaneously is testimony to her tremendous productivity,    Boake said.    She is now returning to work on her third monograph,  The Resources of Hell, a study of the concept of Hell in early modern literature and culture.    Yuri Efremenko, professor of physics, received the Distinguished Career in Research and Creativity Activity Award for his accomplishments over the last decade, which have placed him as a worldwide leader in the important field of neutrino research. Neutrinos, elementary subatomic particles with infinitesimal mass and no electric charge, are extremely challenging to detect. Professor Efremenko was on the team proving that neutrinos have in fact a tiny mass and change    flavor    as they travel through space. He recently led a team of 80 researchers that spotted these elusive particles when bouncing off atomic nuclei in a coherent fashion. This achievement fulfilled a four decade-long search, using a portable detector that weighs as little as a microwave oven.  Such small neutrino detectors might someday help monitor nuclear reactors to ensure they are running according to nuclear nonproliferation regulations, or search for even-more-elusive sterile neutrinos. This work was featured on the cover of Science Magazine and selected by the public as the second most important breakthrough of 2017. The award for New Research, Scholarly, and Creative Projects in the Arts and Humanities went to Emily Bivens, associate professor of Art.    Emily Bivens is easily one of the most productive and exciting faculty artists and a leader in the organization and direction of the School of Art,    Boake said.    Her leadership has been transformational in moving the program to be in line with critical, contemporary art practice.    Bivens   s unique and fascinating project will be presented at the fast disappearing American institution of local drive-in theaters and involve the engagement of local community. It is sure to have broad appeal and the potential to become a feature length film. Bivens has a stellar exhibition and performance record and staged 35 exhibitions and performances at critically significant venues over the past six years. She was recently awarded the Tennessee Arts Commission Individual Artist Fellowship, which includes a solo exhibition at the new Tennessee Museum. Bivens   s individual creative research is in installation, video narratives, and stop motion animation. Her stories come to life, bewitching space and time, through the video and sound interactions of costumed performers, augmented objects, and stop-motion animation that reanimates stuffed animals and inanimate objects. The scientific collaboration between Andreas Nebenf  hr, professor of biochemistry and cellular and molecular biology, and Vasileios Maroulas, professor of mathematics, helped them receive the Interdepartmental Collaborative Scholarship and Research Award. Their collaboration stems from Professor Nebenf  hr   s long-standing cell biology research agenda to develop a rigorous, quantitative basis for the dynamic molecular movement processes known as cytoplasmic streaming, which is the movement of organelles in plants, a process that is essential to plant viability.    Professor Nebenf  hr realized he needed careful and thorough quantitative analysis to further understand the underlying mechanisms,    Boake said.    Looking for a solution, he engaged Professor Maroulas, a mathematician internationally recognized for creating innovative methods to solve difficult data science problems.    Maroulas   s vision to incorporate three distinct areas of mathematics   statistics, topology, and geometry   led to the creation of a novel organelle tracking algorithm with high accuracy. His foundational methods have also found applications in problems related to materials and chemistry. Their collaboration has produced joint publications in high impact journals and a substantial NSF award that involves training students in interdisciplinary research. Next, Associate Dean for Academic Programs Chuck Collins recognized faculty for excellent in teaching at the lecturer, junior, and senior levels. These award winners showcase both their excellence in the classroom and excellence across campus. Kelli MacCartey, distinguished lecturer in the Department of English, received the Lecturer Excellence in Teaching Award.    There are so many reasons she deserves this award, but I think her nominator sums it up the best        The most striking feature of Dr. MacCartey   s teaching career is her sustained pursuit of pedagogical innovation, never for the sake of mere novelty, but always with an eye toward what would work best to suit the learning styles and immediate pedagogical needs of a diverse student body,       Collins said. The result is excellent evaluation results across a wide range of courses and recognition by the college and her department for the development of several new courses, including a successful online version of a poetry course. Sean Lindsay, lecturer and coordinator of astronomy, received the second Lecturer Excellence in Teaching Award. Lindsay brings new life to the astronomy courses through his scientifically rich, technology adept, and student focused classes.    Sean is a real star in the classroom,    Collins said.    As a student says        best instructor I   ve had at UT. His passion for astronomy lights up the room. You can   t help but be excited with him.    Another echoes this sentiment        terrific teacher and went the extra-mile to make sure I succeeded.       One of the best indication of his excellence is that since his arrival, the astronomy program has seen a remarkable renaissance. Manuela Ceballos, assistant professor in the Department of Religious Studies, received the Junior Excellence in Teaching Award.    Her selection should come as no surprise to her students, who, as her nominator wrote, used the word    amazing    in her evaluations too many times to count,    Collins said. This achievement comes while teaching challenging topics (e.g. The Qur   an and the Literature of Islam). She makes this happen through a combination of content expertise in engaging in difficult texts, and a desire to connect to the students by building classroom communities in which vulnerability is not punished, but rather encouraged. Ceballos is making an amazing impact in and out of her classroom. Kelsey Ellis, assistant professor in the Department of Geography, also received the Junior Excellence in Teaching Award. She was nominated based on both her excellence in the classroom and her contributions to the new geography curriculum. In her classes, she focuses on the students acquiring skills and lessons that can be part of their life beyond the semester. One of the ways she achieve this, even in the larger sections, is by designing the course to engage the students in different ways, and to let them know that she truly cares about their success.    As one of her students wrote        students want to be in her classes because she knows how to teach and takes the time to personally engage the students,       Collins said. Greg Stuart, professor of psychology, received a Senior Excellence in Teaching Award. Instead of running down a list of his accolades, Collins read a quote from a student that captured Professor Stuart as a teacher and a mentor.    Dr. Stuart reflects a humble excellence in research, an unparalleled zeal for the field, and a genuine desire to invest in each and every student he encounters,    the student said.    From the help of his incredibly brilliant and dedicated lab team to his valuable, enriching way of teaching his class, I have personally been cultivated and invested in by Dr. Stuart and have watched countless other students, graduate students, faculty members, and patients experience the same day after day. Dr. Stuart deserves the teaching award because he embodies the future of the department as I believe in it and is a foundational piece of what makes our university what it is.    Ed Schilling, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, also received a Senior Excellence in Teaching Award. Professor Schilling brings his 40-plus years of experience and his early inspiration from the awe of the natural world to create a classroom where students want to learn. He is known for using hands-on materials whenever he can, for example, using supplies from the grocery store and his own kitchen for his Socio-economic Impact of Plants course. Another distinguishing aspect of his courses is the detail of his preparation for each class, taking advantage of all available materials and methodologies. The final award in teaching excellence is the James R. and Nell W. Cunningham Award, which is awarded to a tenured faculty member who demonstrates outstanding classroom teaching. Erin Hardin, professor of psychology, has been the recipient of several awards since coming to UT in 2013. In addition to the excellence in research award from this year   s convocation, Hardin has received departmental, college, and society awards. The evidence of her excellence comes through clearly through a student   s comment from a large lecture, introductory general education course.    Dr. Hardin is an outstanding professor,    the student stated.    She made sure that we were getting the    bigger picture    and taught us how to apply psychology outside of the classroom. I now look at the world from a different viewpoint and this has caused me to better understand the things that happen around me.    Dean Lee took to the podium next to present the faculty academic outreach awards for teaching, service, and research and creative activity. Barry Bruce, professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Cellular and Molecular Biology, is changing the world with his research in the areas of photosynthesis, plant cell biology, and bioenergy. He was named    Ten People That May Change the World    by Forbes Magazine in 2007 and again in 2010. Bruce received the Academic Outreach Teaching Award for a variety of his outreach activities at the local, national, and international levels. From Queens, New York, to Tibet, India, Bruce has shared his scientific expertise to help scores of individuals understand basic biology and help change the world through science. As a faculty mentor of high school students in both New York and Hawaii, he provided supplies, equipment, and technical advice for students competing in state and international science and engineering competitions. He has run solar cell workshops in Knoxville, East Tennessee, California, and Costa Rica for high school science teachers.    Perhaps his most intriguing outreach teaching endeavor was his visit to the Sarah Institute for Tibetan Studies in India to introduce Tibetan Buddhist monks to the basics of biology     concepts none of the monks had been exposed to previously,    Lee said.    He helped choreograph the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology, a play where the Monks acted out the process of transcription and protein synthesis. These are just a few examples of the impact his outreach teaching has beyond the UT community.    Ever since she stepped foot on campus in 2011, Erin Darby, associate professor in the Department of Religious Studies, has engaged in outreach with members of the community, both in East Tennessee and around the world, and received the Academic Outreach Service Award.    For years, Dr. Darby has introduced archaeology and the Middle East to our students and our community through several events, including the highly-successful Arab Fest,    Lee said.    Her deep engagement with outreach integrates her research expertise in archaeology with local and international communities in ways that improve the lives of people in our region as well as in Jordan.    Darby   s largest project,    Ayn Gharandal Archaeological Project, expands her research in Jordan into numerous outreach and service learning programs that benefit undergraduate students at UT and the University of Missouri at Columbia, the East Tennessee community, and the government and people of Jordan. Her study abroad program, Dig Jordan, is the only faculty-led study abroad program to the Middle East in the entire UT system. Her outreach has impacted scores of UT students as well as large audiences in East Tennessee and significant international communities. Vejas Liulevicius, director of the Center for the Study of War and Society, received the Academic Outreach Research and Creative Activity Award, for his work with the Veterans Legacy Project. UT is one of a half dozen schools across the country funded as part of the Veterans Legacy Project, which uses national veterans cemeteries as a way to help communities remember our nation   s history and the contribution of our veterans. Through the project, Liulevicius created a partnership between UT, the Knox County School System, the East Tennessee History Society, and the Knoxville History Project. He recruited, trained, and supervised several UT undergraduate students to conduct research about the lives of some of the veterans buried in the Knoxville National Cemetery, one of the oldest in the country. His work brings together the shared resources of UT faculty and student researchers, the local school system, and two of our most important local historical societies and expands the community outreach role of the Center across the East Tennessee region. Associate Dean for Academic Personnel Andy Kramer recognized faculty who have university and college professorships before awarding the Lorayne W. Lester Award for outstanding service through research, outreach, administration, teaching, or advising to the college, the local community, the state, and beyond to Kurt Butefish in the Department of Geography.    In the words of his nominator, Kurt Butefish    embodies the description    of the Lorayne W. Lester Award with his outstanding service and outreach as coordinator of the Tennessee Geographic Alliance,    Kramer said. Since taking the reins as executive director in 2001, Butefish has built an extensive network of dedicated teachers and professionals to support geography education at the K-12 level in Tennessee and focused on providing professional development and resource materials for teachers and students. He has also worked diligently since 2012 to influence the inclusion of geography in Tennessee   s social studies standards, including the addition of a new Introduction to GIS course. Butefish has served two, four-year terms as the elected executive director of the Tennessee Council for the Social Studies, the statewide professional organization representing social studies teachers. He is also on the board of directors of the Tennessee Geographic Information Council, the largest organization in the state for GIS professionals, where he works to bridge the gap between K-12 education and the needs of GIS professional communities. At the national level, Butefish ensured geography was adequately represented in the final version of the Every Student Succeeds Act.    Kurt has helped put UT geography on the map at local, state, and national levels,    Kramer said.    He is an integral member of the geography department and our college.    Dean Lee returned to the podium to present the final honor of the evening     College Marshal Award, which in the college equivalent of the university Macebearer and the highest college honor awarded to a member of the faculty. This year, the honor went to Bill Black, professor in the Department of Theatre.    Professor Bill Black is a model of teaching excellence, professional accomplishment, and university service,    Lee said.    This year, he celebrates his 41st year with the Department of Theatre. And this year, we honor his commitment by naming him College Marshal.    Professor Black joined the university in 1977 as the supervisor of the costume shop. He became a member of the faculty in 1984, teaching courses in costume technology. Since his appointment, Black has distinguished himself in all areas of teaching, service, and research and creative activity and has designed extensively for numerous theatres across the United States. He is a regular costume designer at the Utah Shakespearean Festival. His costume designs have also appeared at the Alabama Shakespeare Festival, Milwaukee Repertory Theatre, Denver Theatre Center, and PlayMaker   s Repertory. Current and former students, including Dale Dickey, sing his praises as a teacher, mentor, and advisor.    His contribution to the education of hundreds of young costume designers and technicians is impossible to calculate,    Lee said. Black has amassed an impressive record of professional and administrative accomplishments while at UT. He served as interim head for the theatre department on two separate occasions and, since 2006, has served as the associate head. Nominations for the 2019 faculty awards will be open in fall of 2019.

He will begin working 25 percent of the time with outgoing Associate Dean Chris Boake next semester. McKay will take over full-time August 1, 2019, when Associate Dean Boake retires.    I   d like to thank Chris Boake for her leadership and hard work on projects like Strong Hall and the Mossman building,    McKay says.    Completion of these projects will allow me to develop new priorities, in consultation with the college and the departments and schools.

The CCAS is the national association of deans of colleges of arts and sciences. The purpose is to provide professional development programming to its member deans and to sustain the arts and sciences as a leading influence in American higher education. CCAS serves as a forum for the exchange of ideas and information among deans of arts and sciences representing the member colleges and as a representative of the liberal arts and sciences at a national policy-making level. Members of the UT College of Arts and Sciences leadership attend the annual meeting, which took place in Chicago this year. The theme focused on navigating the complexities of the deanship and included presentations on topics relating to academic freedom and free speech, building alliances, fostering diversity, promoting the value of a liberal arts education, and more. Visit their website to learn more about CCAS.","link":"https:\/\/artsci.utk.edu\/dialogue\/dean-lee-named-ccas-president-elect\/"},{"title":"Hitting the Mark","content":"Hitting the Mark Did you hear?

People in every department of our college interact with Barnett     whether one-on-one, via email, or through personnel files. She is one of the key people who keeps the college running at full steam. Barnett, the assistant director of human resources for the College of Arts and Sciences, is celebrating her 25th year at UT. She joined the College of Arts and Sciences Office of the Dean as a temporary employee in September 1993. A few months later, an opportunity to work part time in the Germanic and Slavic languages opened up and Barnett became a full-time UT employee.    I am very fortunate to have a job where I enjoy what I do every day,    Barnett says.    I really enjoy the people I work with, and working with and learning from Ann (Robinson-Craig) has been     and continues to be     a true pleasure.    Barnett is originally from Knoxville. She lives in Maryville now with her two sons and loves the area. When she is not at work, she enjoys hiking and reading.    As a true soccer mom, I really like watching my younger son   s soccer games,    Barnett says. If she could do anything in the world, Barnett said she would audition for musicals in local theatres. For now, however, she sings in her church choir, which she thoroughly enjoys. As for lunch with anyone, Barnett would love to dine with Samwise Gamgee     her favorite hero from the Lord of the Rings trilogy.    He never gets all the credit he deserves!

Sara Ritchey Ritchey, associate professor of history, and Miller, assistant professor of French, both received grants of $60,000, the only two NEH fellowships given to researchers at Tennessee universities. Both professors have appointments with the Marco Institute for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, UT   s internationally acclaimed center for the study of history and culture from approximately 300 to 1700 AD. Ritchey received the award for her research into religious women   s medical knowledge and health care practices in 13th-century Europe. The grant enables her to spend all of 2019 completing her book Salvation is Medicine  Gender and the Caregiving Communities of Late Medieval Europe.    This will provide me with time to reflect deeply on my sources and arguments, and to engage with interdisciplinary scholarship in the medical humanities, performance studies, and gender studies,    said Ritchey.    But on a more personal level, it means that someone out there believes in this project and in my ability to carry it out, and I am incredibly grateful for their support and for this opportunity.    Anne-H  l  ne Miller Miller will use her grant to continue her research into the development of 14th-century French literary culture. She plans to publish a book, The Formation of a Francophone Identity in Fourteenth-Century Literature, which will challenge the standard narrative about the origin and evolution of French language.    This is probably the highest recognition you can receive in the humanities for your scholarship,    Miller said.    I am honored to receive it and delighted to be able to pursue further my research.    The NEH makes awards based on evaluation criteria that include the project   s value to humanities scholars and the public, its quality, and the likelihood that it will be completed. Grants totaling $14.8 million were awarded to 253 projects across 44 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Since the start of the program in 1967, UT faculty have been awarded 32 NEH fellowships, 18 of those since 2005 when the Office of Research and Engagement created a position to assist faculty in the pursuit of humanities awards. The 18 NEH fellowships rank UT ninth in the nation in the number of these prestigious awards received since ORE started this initiative.

I hope you had an enjoyable winter break and are rested and ready for an exciting spring semester. I am very excited to have a Vice Chancellor for Diversity and Inclusion in place for the campus. Tyvi Small stepped into the interim position January 2. He will lead efforts to coordinate the student success programs and diversity initiatives already in place across the university. Angie Batey, the associate dean for diversity and inclusion for our college, has already met with Tyvi to discuss several diversity initiatives, including development of education materials and the UT Diversity Summit. Tyvi Small is well prepared for this job because of his experiences on the university   s strategic planning diversity and inclusion working group and the Council for Diversity and Interculturalism, as well as his work on recruitment and diversity within the Haslam College of Business. Earlier this month, Interim President Randy Boyd announced the search for our new Chancellor. According to Boyd, the ideal candidate for this position will    incorporate a    students-first    culture in everything they do.    I hope you take the opportunity to meet potential candidates as they visit our campus. Information about the search, including the job description, is available on the search website. Another exciting piece of news for the spring semester is the opening of the new Student Union. More than nine years in the making, the Student Union is the largest project in UT   s history. If you have not already had the opportunity to walk through the 395,000-square-foot building, I encourage you to take a break and walk through this beautiful building. I hear the line at Steak    n Shake is little long, however, so go early or late, or make plans for one of the other food courts in the building. https   www.youtube.com watch?v=rIT45h5VP64 In other new-building news, while the opening of the Mossman building has been difficult, the research functions of the building are finally being brought fully online. Many thanks to our faculty, staff, and students for your patience as we worked out the kinks. Thank you for your work in the College of Arts and Sciences.

After graduating, Wall and her husband moved to Arizona where she worked as the finance director for a large nonprofit animal shelter while he completed his coursework for a doctoral degree in the School of Justice and Social Inquiry at Arizona State University. They moved back to Indiana to welcome their first child, Zaela. Before coming to UT, Wall worked as the director of finance for residential programs and services at Indiana University.    My favorite thing about UT is its location,    said Wall, who is originally from Southern Indiana. When she is not at work, Wall spends her time as a chauffeur to her two daughters     Zaela, a dancer, and Sadie, a gymnast.    I spend a lot of time taking them to practice or competition,    Wall said.    We also have a puppy that likes to go to on long walks and is always causing trouble.    When Wall gets time for herself, she hits the gym for a cycling class. Her life motto?    A day without laughter is a day wasted.

It is the tenth honorary degree that UT has awarded. She   s had recurring TV roles on long-running series including Christy, My Name is Earl, and True Blood. She received the Film Independent Spirit Award for her performance in the Oscar-nominated movie Winter   s Bone. Her other film credits include Domino, Changeling, The Guilt Trip, Being Flynn, Super 8, and Iron Man 3. Dickey also has appeared in many stage performances, on and off Broadway, and she   s performed at the Clarence Brown Theatre many times. She first graced that stage as a child and appeared in twenty productions before enrolling as a student at UT. Even after finding success in Hollywood, Dickey has made time to return to Clarence Brown Theatre to star in productions and mentor students. She   s been in Steel Magnolias (1990), Our Country   s Good (1994), The Rainmaker (2001), A Streetcar Named Desire (2009), and Sweeney Todd (as a student in 1983, and again in 2012).

Our college has awarded only a few honorary degrees and there are many opportunities for more,    remarked Theresa Lee, dean of the College of Arts and Sciences.    I encourage faculty to identify candidates for an honorary degree from the college and present them to department heads for consideration.

Brown Memorial University Center. The program featured lectures by outstanding faculty two hours before home football games. The location was centrally located on campus and the university center   s food service venues attracted Vol fans without tailgating plans. Vol fans arrived on campus early (two hours before kick-off) to hear the lecture and participate in the reception following the lecture, and still had plenty of time to get to their seats in the stadium before kick-off. When the university center was closed and the building was razed to make way for new construction, the college administration searched for a new location for the program in fall 2015 and found what appeared to be an optimal location   McClung Museum in Circle Park. The McClung Museum staff welcomed the program and became strong supporting partners. Some Pregame Showcase fans followed the program to its new location  however, many did not. The audience total for the season was 363, an average attendance of fifty-two per game, which was remarkable considering the change in venue. However, the total attendance was still dramatically down from the 2014 season attendance total of 571 and an average attendance of 71. Many Vol fans who had regularly attended the Pregame Showcase program were discouraged by the challenge of having to make their way through the crowd of enthusiastic tailgaters in the congested Circle Park area, and then through the museum to the downstairs auditorium meeting space for the program. Prior to the last game, an elevation of national security concerns prompted UT Athletics to require fans to arrive at the gate thirty minutes earlier to accommodate additional security checks. This policy posed an additional challenge for the Pregame Showcase audience. With Pregame Showcase beginning two hours before kick-off and ending an hour later for those who participate in the reception, there was less time for Pregame Showcase guests to meet the earlier arrival time at the gates for increased security checks. At the conclusion of the 2015 season, and after consultation with long-standing supporters of the Pregame Showcase, the college administration made the call to suspend the program until Phase II of the construction of the Student Union is completed in 2018. At that time the Pregame Showcase can once again be hosted in the Student Union   a less congested and central part of campus with easier access for those who wish to attend Pregame Showcase rather than tailgating.","link":"https:\/\/artsci.utk.edu\/pregame-showcase-lecture-series-takes-a-time-out\/"},{"title":"College Presents Annual Alumni, Philanthropy Awards","content":"College Presents Annual Alumni, Philanthropy Awards  caption id= attachment_6366  align= alignleft  width= 960   Front row, left to right  Dottie Habel (accepted award on behalf of Paige Braddock)  Theresa Lee, Dean  Cynthia Tinker (accepted award on behalf of John McManus)  Back row, left to right  Jim Nixon (accepted the award on behalf of John Turley)  Mark Boling(accepted the award on behalf of his father, Edward Boling)  Jeff Becker (accepted award on behalf of Tim Townes)  Tom Burman (accepted on behalf of George Demacopoulos)  Cortney Piper, and Ashley Capps.

As I write this message at the close of the academic year, I am filled with pride and gratitude. The publication of the college   s annual report this year renewed my sense of pride in our college as we had the opportunity to focus on distinctive programs in the college, to highlight examples of the extraordinary work of faculty and students, and to celebrate the opportunities we have been able to extend to talented students as a result of the generosity of our alumni and friends. Also occurring this semester was the Chancellor   s Honors Banquet which brought another wave of pride when our faculty, staff, and students took home the lion   s share of the awards and honors. Messages of the achievements, awards, and recognitions of our faculty and students appear regularly in my email throughout the year signally they are competitive on the national and international scene as well. Commencement in a few days will mark the high point of my college pride in our collective accomplishment of preparing our graduates for their journey into the future. Complementing my sense of pride is my gratitude for the privilege of leading our college and for the faculty and staff who join me every day in working to accomplish our missions and advance the college. I   m also grateful that we have withstood considerable criticism from external voices this year and the end effect is less impactful than it might have been. The experience has only strengthened and united us in our commitment to our core values. Since the last issue of Dialogue, there are a number of leadership changes to report. In the Dean   s Office  The search for the position of Associate Dean for Academic Programs has been completed. Chuck Collins was offered the position and agreed to accept it--giving up his interim title, and accepting a five-year term. Last year Lynn Sacco accepted a new part-time position (25%) as Director of Interdisciplinary, International, and Experiential (still developing) Programs. This arrangement has allowed the college to have a much more active and responsive interaction with the chairs directors of various programs both within the college and across other units. Lynn has agreed to continue in that part-time role (25%) position for the next academic year. Angie Batey originally accepted the part-time position of Associate Dean for Diversity, defining the duties of that position and advancing the college   s diversity agenda. Through collaboration and partnership with the Vice Chancellor for Diversity, she has also worked on behalf of the college and its units to take advantage of any funding programming that would benefit us. The initial term of her appointment was for three years  however, she has agreed to the extension of that appointment to the full five-year term. Brent Mallinckrodt, Associate Dean for Graduate Studies, recently announced that he will leave us at the end of June to accept the position of Dean of the College of Humanities and Social Sciences at Western Washington University in Bellingham, Washington, effective July 1. A search committee has been formed and Associate Dean Andy Kramer is serving as committee chair. The advertisement has been submitted for approval and we expect that position to be posted very soon. It will be an internal search, so my expectation is that we can complete the process and have someone take up that role no later than Aug 1. The position will continue to be a 50% appointment. As previously announced, Lynn Champion will be retiring at the end of August. A search committee has been formed with Executive Director of Development Andrew Sheehy serving as chair. The advertisement for the Director of Communications has been posted internally and nationally. Interviews will be scheduled within the next six weeks. We expect to fill this position and have a new director in place by the end of August. In Departments  The leadership of two more departments has been resolved since the last issue of this newsletter. With the support of the faculty in the Department of Chemistry, Chuck Feigerle has agreed to another five-year term as department head. In the Department of Classics, Aleydis VandeMortel has been appointed to a five-year term as department head. She replaces Chris Craig who served as department head for two consecutive five-year terms. I know that many of you have plans for summer research and others will be involved in teaching summer classes. No matter what your summer schedule entails, I hope all of you have an opportunity to take a break, relax, and refresh your spirit before we return in August to launch the new academic year.

This committee advises the Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation. For his students, however, his most impressive feat has been taking the challenging senior-level course on  quantum mechanics and, with his talent and enthusiasm, making it the most popular course in the department. Alumni Outstanding Teacher Awards Alumni Outstanding Teacher awards are bestowed by the UT Alumni Association to recognize teaching excellence. Ronald Kalafsky Ronald Kalafsky has worked to develop materials and projects in each of his courses that help students see why chosen concepts are relevant to their lives. Kalafsky is an associate professor and the director of undergraduate studies in the Department of Geology. His contributions to learning reach past the classroom. He contributes to the Haslam Scholars Program and created a First-Year Studies course,    Cities in the Cinema.

Dr. Beth Schussler is a pioneer and leader at all levels. The University of Tennessee is lucky to have such a dedicated teacher, and teacher of teachers.    Anthony Welch Anthony Welch, associate professor of English, seeks ways to maintain relationships with his students outside the classroom. He has organized widely popular marathon oral readings and orchestrated a study abroad course in Stratford and London. Welch is a specialist in English Renaissance literature, particularly works written between 1500 and 1700. He brings a learned and engaging presence to the classroom. His students cherish his ability to make difficult texts and their rich historical contexts come to life in sophisticated and imaginative ways. A student wrote,    He brings a fresh, lively outlook to the material he teaches. He has a captivating voice, he does more work for the class than any other teacher I   ve ever had, and he makes slightly dry material very entertaining and extremely thought-provoking. I wish I could stay at UT another year just to take more classes with him.    Excellence in Advising Excellence in Advising  is bestowed by the Office of the Chancellor and the Teaching Council of the Faculty Senate to honor outstanding work in advising. Sekeenia Haynes As administrator for the National Institutes for Health   funded Program for Excellence and Equity in Research, Sekeenia Haynes draws on inspiration from her own great teachers and mentors to help students underrepresented in science, engineering, technology, and mathematics succeed. Haynes   s ultimate goals as an advisor are to empower students and encourage them to pursue socially meaningful careers in science, education, and health.

Students she advises are impressed with her level of commitment to their success. Remus Nicoara Remus Nicoara is an associate mathematics professor and director of the Math Honors program. Focusing on the goal of embracing diversity, he views advising as a reciprocal process, treating his advisees and mentees as colleagues no matter what level of study they have attained. One of his advisees has this to say     I have learned from Dr. Nicoara that advice is not something that you take out of a can for the person in front of you, but is rather something that you construct for the person in front of you.    Nicoara exemplifies this personalized approach by taking the time to get to know students by learning from them how to better develop their competence, confidence, and sense of purpose. Excellence in Teaching Excellence in Teaching  is bestowed by the Office of the Chancellor and the Teaching Council of the Faculty Senate to honor outstanding work in the classroom. Heather Hirschfeld Heather Hirschfeld   s student-centered teaching practice    grows out of the belief that original, creative insights about centuries-old texts are uniquely available to the students who populate  her  courses, both majors and nonmajors alike, and that  she has  much to learn from them.    Students praise Hirschfeld for her expertise in the field of Renaissance literature and for her contagious enthusiasm, which they feel plays a central role in making the sometimes difficult material accessible to them. One English major remarked that she    was inspired to try to match  Hirschfeld   s  intellect.    Malissa Peery Malissa Peery has spent the past few years working to redevelop the delivery of MATH 119, bringing it into alignment with her philosophy that    teaching involves motivating students to learn, making them responsible for their learning, giving them the tools they need to learn successfully,  and  delivering the course content in a way they can understand.    She now uses the flipped model, which has been very well received by students. She has shared her materials and methods with other instructors, influencing the learning of hundreds of students in MATH 119. Evaluators have been impressed by both the design of her questions and the high level of student concentration. 2016 Extraordinary Customer Service The Extraordinary Customer Service award is given to a university employee who is consistently optimistic and serves students, faculty, staff, and campus visitors with great care. Chrisanne Romeo Chrisanne Romeo has worked as an administrative specialist in the Department of Physics and Astronomy for five years, long enough to inspire many letters of appreciation from students. She   s described as warm and efficient.    She always cuts right through red tape like scissors through the ribbon of a grand opening,    writes one nominator.    I would say that if we were a family, she would be the mother,    said another grateful student. She helps to fill an enormous need within her department by helping students with emergency situations and providing accurate and timely information. She helps new students make the transition into the department and has even taken the time to give each student a gift bag for their birthday. 2016 Hardy Liston Jr. Symbol of Hope Award The Hardy Liston Jr. Symbol of Hope Award goes to a faculty member, staff member, or friend of the university who demonstrates a commitment to diversity, multiculturalism, and appreciation of the differences in people and cultures on our campus. Ernest Brothers Ernest Brothers, associate dean of the Graduate School, is a tireless advocate for graduate students. He is passionate about recruiting, retaining, and graduating underrepresented students with advanced degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields. Brothers, who also serves as associate director of diversity enhancement for the National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis, established GeoMap, a tool that shares venue information and opportunities with departments seeking to recruit underrepresented students to UT. He helped launch the Multicultural Graduate Student Organization, a group focused on building a community for students from diverse backgrounds. As director of the Office of Graduate Training and Mentorship, Brothers has helped shape the mentoring culture at UT. One nominator lauded his    distinctive mentoring style informed by his deep caring for graduate student success,    adding,    As I struggled to complete my dissertation     I regularly called on Dr. Brothers for his words of encouragement. I later found that many of my colleagues and friends did the same.    2016 Jefferson Prize The Jefferson Prize honors a tenured or tenure-track faculty member who has demonstrated excellence in research and creative activity. Charles Sanft Charles Sanft   s work is helping make UT a leader in the field of Chinese history. His research shows how imperial leaders used communication to win the allegiance and enlist the support of common people across a vast territory. Experts have described him as one of the most important young scholars working in the field of ancient Chinese history and note that many of his published articles have been transformative. An associate professor of history, he has published Communication and Cooperation in Early Imperial China, a monograph with the SUNY Press Series on Chinese Philosophy and Culture. He currently is working on a second book, which addresses literacy in early China. Sanft is a leader and mentor in the history department and has led workshops for colleagues on teaching techniques and new uses of technology.

Originally from Eritrea, Tekie was accepted to UT in 2008 but could not begin his program at that time because authorities refused to allow him to leave the country. After many unsuccessful attempts to escape from the East African nation of Eritrea, he finally arrived in Knoxville in 2012. In almost four years, Tekie has completed a master   s degree in psychology and expects to finish both a master   s in statistics and a graduate certificate in evaluation, statistics, and measurement in May 2017. Tekie previously served as a psychology advanced practicum clinician at the UT Counseling Center and is now serving as a substance abuse counselor at the Cornerstone of Recovery treatment facility. Since 2013, he has served as a graduate teaching associate in psychology courses and has been invited to speak at graduate seminars and national conferences on topics of coping, resilience, and strategies for helping survivors of torture. He is working with faculty in the College of Law Immigration Clinic as a social justice practicum intern to develop a combined service for refugees that meets both their legal and psychological needs. His career plans include combining academic research and teaching with applied work to perfect treatment techniques for trauma survivors and ways to deliver the treatments to underserved populations. One nominator said that    in thirty-one years of faculty service, I have never worked with a student as courageous or determined as Yacob. He has an effervescent personality, positive outlook, and warmth that is instantly engaging and uplifting for everyone he meets.    2016 LGBT Advocate Award The LGBT Advocate Award recognizes a faculty member, staff member, or student who demonstrates a commitment to advancing lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender issues on campus. Leticia Flores For Leticia Flores, helping LGBT individuals live healthier and happier lives has been a career-long commitment. Now, as interim director of the UT Psychology Clinic, she is working to make UT a more welcoming and nurturing place for LGBT students, faculty, and staff. Since arriving in 2013, she has tried to train her doctoral students in clinical and counseling psychology how to provide culturally competent psychology services to their LGBT clients.    But it is in the smaller day-to-day activities that Dr. Flores hopes to have the greatest impact,    her nominator noted. Flores routinely distributes materials to keep clinical students and supervisors abreast of LGBT issues and has helped make the clinic   s website a go-to information source for the LGBT community. She networks with others in the campus community who are deeply involved in LBGT issues and looks for opportunities to join forces to help current, past, and future students. Flores is a board member for Positively Living, a Knoxville organization that helps men struggling to survive the challenges created by HIV AIDS, homelessness, mental illness, addiction, and disabilities. She also serves on the advisory committee for Alcoa   s new LBGT community center. 2016 Macebearer The Macebearer is the highest faculty honor at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, and is symbolic of the faculty   s commitment of service to students, to scholarship, and to society.

Research and Creative Achievement Research and Creative Achievement honors are bestowed to senior faculty in recognition of excellence in research, scholarship, and creative achievement. Daniela Corbetta Psychology professor Daniela Corbetta focuses on the development of human infants in their first year of life in order to understand how early sensorimotor experience affects future cognitive development. Her lab is the only infancy lab to combine two different technologies, eye-tracking and motion analysis, to conduct this important research. Corbetta   s innovative research approach has led to collaborations with engineers in computer science and robotics to see if it is possible to teach a robot how to reach and grasp by using her longitudinal infant data. She won a competitive Major Research Instrumentation grant from the National Science Foundation to further this research. Her research has appeared in a number of important journals and involves collaborations with colleagues from France, Portugal, and Brazil. Thomas Papenbrock Thomas Papenbrock, a professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy, is a prolific researcher and dedicated teacher who is respected for his work by the department and the international physics community. His research in theoretical nuclear physics focuses on neutron-rich nuclear isotopes, which occur rarely enough that they serve to elucidate aspects of physics that are not as apparent in the more stable nuclei around us. His work has appeared in journals such as Nature, Physics, and Physical Review Letters. He won the Department of Energy   s prestigious Outstanding Young Investigator Award in 2007 and the senior Humboldt Fellowship in 2010. Last year, the American Physical Society elected him a fellow. Research and Creative Achievement   Professional Promise Research and Creative Achievement     Professional Promise awards honor faculty members who are early in their careers for excellence in research, scholarship, and creative achievement.

As has been the case for the past three summers, our students and those of you who left campus for the summer are returning to city streets and a campus marked by construction all around us, cone zones, and detour signs. Although the construction is causing temporary inconvenience for everyone, the campus-wide improvements in our physical work environment are needed and welcomed. Enhancement of our campus facilities and landscape are key elements in attracting the best and brightest students and providing a more functional and pleasant work space for faculty and staff. Within the college, construction of the Ken and Blaire Mossman building is coming along well and remarkable progress has been made on the construction of Strong Hall. In fact, representatives of the future occupants of Strong Hall have been touring the building in recent weeks. By the end of this month we expect to have a refined update on the schedule for holding classes in that building and the phased moving of the designated departments. We eagerly anticipate beginning the fall 2017 semester with undergraduate biology and chemistry courses housed in new state-of-the-art teaching environments. On a smaller scale, the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology will benefit from a small greenhouse that is being added to the existing ones at Senter Hall. That project is almost finished. In addition to the improvements in the landscape and facilities, the arrival of a new class of very bright students, and pay raises again this year, we have more good news and reason to celebrate. We have made great faculty hires this year! Seventeen of our twenty-one departments will welcome a total of twenty-nine new faculty colleagues as they join the college family for the first day of classes this week, enriching the intellectual capacity and enhancing the diversity of our college. The announcement of the talents and qualifications of the new freshman class promise that faculty will have another group of bright and talented students to teach and to challenge us. UT Knoxville has had another record-setting year of freshmen enrollment. With 4,825 incoming freshmen, the Class of 2020 is the largest in at least thirty years, and marks the sixth consecutive year of freshman growth. The credentials of the Class of 2020 continue the university   s decade record of attracting a freshman class that gets better each year. This year   s freshmen have an average ACT score of twenty-seven and an average high school GPA of 3.89. Forty-nine percent had high school GPAs over 4.0. About ten percent of the freshmen are enrolled in UT Honors programs. We also continue to see growth in our out-of-state undergraduate population, now expected to be seventeen percent. The size of the increase is a bit more than expected. As a result, most of our first year class sections are full, and in some cases there are long wait lists. In addition, we expect an increased number of transfer students which may put some pressure on upper level courses as well. Please be patient as the various departments, faculty, advisors, and administrators deal with last minute changes to try to accommodate students as well as is possible. I also want you to be aware that the housing situation has not resolved as expected  one new dorm is not opening on time and a large private apartment building designed for students, and already rented, is not opening on time. Consequently, during the first weeks of class some students are going to be particularly stressed. There is, however, some good news for commuting students (and faculty and staff) because there are additional parking options on campus this year. Even as we celebrate our successes, we are launching the new semester facing challenges. At the campus level several members of our seasoned campus leadership team have decided to retire or seek positions at another university, resulting in interim appointments in a number of key campus leadership positions, and a year ahead of searching to fill the vacancies. These personnel changes could potentially dampen morale and stall our momentum of advancement toward the college   s goals. We cannot allow this to happen. Our campus leadership has provided a clear vision for our journey to the Top 25 and we have made steady and remarkable progress on that journey. Our updated campus strategic plans are our roadmap to continue the journey and maintain our pace as we work together to achieve the goals we have set for the college. In the coming year, we will review our strategic plans in both the college and departments to align them with the campus plan. Chancellor Cheek will continue leading our campus until a new chancellor is appointed with strong support from his cabinet (both continuing and interim appointees). I call on you to join me in renewing our enthusiasm and energy for advancing the college. As we begin this academic year, we will also be dealing with the unfinished business of the legislature   s defunding of the university   s diversity office. We must continue to work together to find ways to make progress on the broadly and deeply embedded diversity goals in our strategic plans, to nurture and sustain a welcoming environment for all of our students, and to honor our responsibility for preparing our students to live and pursue careers in a global community. Fortunately, the Faculty Senate, the Division of Student Life, the colleges, and many faculty and staff members are contributing to the efforts to develop sustaining supportive programming for diversity and inclusion for students, faculty, and staff during the coming year. In our classes, we need to be mindful of the emotional distress many of our students are experiencing as they process and seek to understand the proliferation of intolerance, violence, and terrorism in our communities near and far, both within the United States and abroad. Social unrest in our own country is at the highest level in recent years and in the lifetime of most of our students. Moreover, we are engaged in one of the most contentious presidential elections in our country   s history and the rhetoric is shrill and divisive. As appropriate for class goals, consider providing students opportunities to write and talk about issues of concern to them, encouraging them to employ the intellectual tool honed by our curriculum   critical thinking   to think clearly and rationally about what to do or what to believe, systematically evaluating their own values, attitudes, and perspectives, and those of others. In other sections of this newsletter you will read about the college   s third annual celebration of staff last May, including the presentation of staff awards. You   ll also read about new faces in the college office and leadership appointments at the department level, and more.  I hope you will take time to catch up on the college news. I always welcome your thoughts about any topic on your mind and invite you to write to me at artscidean@utk.edu. Please feel free to suggest topics you would like me or others in my office to address in future issues of Dialogue. Thank you for all you have done and continue to do to advance our college. Have a wonderful semester! With best regards, Theresa M.

A theoretical condensed matter physicist, he holds a joint appointment with the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and is bringing theory to the experimental research conducted at the Skull Wollan Center   a joint institute for neutron sciences (JINS). Batista was named Fellow of the American Physical Society in 2015. Sowjanya Gollapinni Assistant Professor Sowjanya Gollapinni specializes in experimental high-energy particle physics. She earned the doctorate at Wayne State University in Detroit in 2012. She has just completed a postdoctoral fellowship at Kansas State University and Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory before joining UT. Gollapinni developed scientific equipment for the detection of extraterrestrial neutrino particles, mysterious particles that permeate our bodies by the billions each second while moving at the speed of light.   Her research on so-called neutrino oscillations aims to answer some of the most profound questions in science, such as the mystery of the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe. Political Science Emily Schilling Assistant Professor Emily Schilling completed a doctorate at the University of Iowa and a postdoctoral research fellowship at Washington University in St. Louis. Her interests include American politics, methodology, and formal theory, focusing on the U.S. Congress and state legislatures. Her recent research has focused on how legislators make decisions and how they influence one another   s behavior. Employing spatial econometrics, she addresses a gap in the literature on legislative decision making between theories that emphasize how each legislator s decisions depend on those made by their colleagues, and the empirical methods that are not able to capture this interdependence. Psychology Shannon Ross-Sheehy Assistant Professor Shannon Ross-Sheehy earned a doctorate from the University of Iowa and completed postdoctoral training at the University of Iowa Children   s Hospital. She accepted an assistant professor appointment at East Tennessee State University where she received funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to study functional brain development in infants. Her primary research interests are in the co-development of visual attention and other cognitive systems, and how underlying neural substrates both support and are supported by the development of visual-cognitive competency. Her work may one day lead to identifying infants most at risk for cognitive deficits. Kalynn Schulz Assistant Professor Kalynn Schulz completed a doctorate in behavioral neuroscience at Michigan State University and postdoctoral training at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, where she was appointed assistant professor of psychiatry.   At the University of Colorado, she received a career development award from the Veterans Administration. Schulz   s research investigates the impact of external factors such as stress and internal factors such as gonadal steroid hormones on brain and behavioral development. She is particularly interested in determining the neural mechanisms mediating the relationship between developmental stress exposure and mental illness, and between pubertal timing and mental illness. Religious Studies Helene Sinnreich Associate Professor and Director, Fern and Manfred Steinfeld Program in Judaic Studies Helene Sinnreich earned a Doctor of Philosophy degree at Brandeis University in 2004. She joins UT from Youngstown State University where she was Clayman Family Professor of Judaic and Holocaust Studies, Director of the Center for Judaic and Holocaust Studies, and Executive Director of Ohio Council for Holocaust Education. She is former fellow at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (2007) and Yad Vashem (2009), and Editor-in-Chief of Journal of Jewish Identities. Her general research interests include the Holocaust, genocide, Jewish studies, and food and famine studies. Theatre Gina Di Salvo Assistant Professor Gina Di Salvo completed a doctorate in theatre and drama at Northwestern University, a master   s degree at Ohio State University, and a bachelor   s degree at Catholic University of America. For the past two years she has been a lecturer at Northwestern University. A professional dramaturge, she is an artistic associate of Chicago   s Sideshow Theatre Company.

An internal search chaired by Chris Boake was conducted this spring and the committee subsequently recommended Chuck for the position. He accepted the offer and agreed to a five-year term. The position is now a full-time (one hundred percent) appointment. Chuck was also promoted this year from associate professor to professor of mathematics. Todd Moore, associate professor of psychology, has been appointed interim associate dean of graduate studies for the coming year. Todd   s administrative experience includes serving as director of the Clinical Psychology Program and as a member of the board of directors for CONTACT Crisis Helpline of Oak Ridge since 2011. An internal search to fill the position will be conducted with the goal of making a permanent appointment for the next academic year. The position will continue to be a fifty percent appointment. The associate dean for graduate studies position was vacated by Brent Mallinckrodt who left the college at the end of June to become dean of the College of Humanities and Social Sciences at Western Washington University. Angie Batey, professor of music, accepted the twenty-five percent position as associate dean for diversity when the position had not yet been clearly defined. The college needed someone to advocate for diversity and advance our diversity goals across the college when the new vice chancellor for diversity was appointed at the university level. We hoped to take advantage of any funding and programming available to colleges through the vice chancellor   s office. Now that the vice chancellor for diversity   s office has been dismantled, the need for a dedicated staff member to advocate for diversity and advance the college   s diversity goals is imperative. Angie   s initial term was for three years  however, she has agreed to an extension of her appointment to a full five-year term. The position remains a twenty-five percent appointment. Lynn Sacco, associate professor of history, has served in a new part-time position working with international, interdisciplinary, and experiential programs. This arrangement has allowed the college to have a much more active and responsive interaction with the chairs and directors of various programs both within the college and across campus. Lynn has agreed to continue in that part-time role (twenty-five percent appointment) as director of interdisciplinary, international, and experiential programs.","link":"https:\/\/artsci.utk.edu\/associate-dean-and-director-appointments-and-reappointments\/"},{"title":"Six Extraordinary Staff Receive College Awards","content":"Six Extraordinary Staff Receive College Awards Presentation of staff awards in several categories was the centerpiece of the third annual celebration of staff held on Tuesday, May 24, from 3 30-5 00 p.m. on the South Lawn of Ayres Hall. Associate Dean Chris Boake organized the nomination and selection process and served as the college liaison to the committee convened to select the winners from the many worthy nominees. Nominations for staff awards were solicited from staff and faculty throughout the college. Dean Theresa Lee welcomed the group, thanked all attending staff for their service, and presented the six awards. Pamela Whaley, Department of English, was the recipient of the Outstanding Academic Support Award. Pamela Whaley was honored for her dedication to the well-being and success of undergraduate students in the Department of English, through her efforts to make them feel welcome, engaged, and at home in a large and diverse department. Pam greets warmly every undergraduate student who walks through the department   s office doors, helps them with their various needs, and remembers nearly all of the department   s more than 350 student majors by name, interest, and area of concentration--a remarkable feat of memory. Pam plays an indispensable role at the center of the department   s initiative to unify their undergraduate majors and foster a sense of community within their undergraduate program. Debra Johnson, Department of Physics and Astronomy, was the recipient of the Outstanding Financial Support Award. Debra Johnson has mastered the art of providing faculty in the Department of Physics and Astronomy with the support they need for preparation, submission, and management of research grants. Her duties include assisting faculty with grant applications, grant budgeting, equipment inventory, and many other financial support tasks. Debra has taken all the IRIS training that is offered and has completed the new sponsored projects accounting financial certification to enhance her skills and knowledge. She has also developed collaborative relationships with staff in the Office of Sponsored Programs to facilitate teamwork in the grant submission process. Faculty nominators declare her an indispensable resource. David Pratt, Division of Biology, received the Outstanding Technical Support Award. David Pratt has served the College of Arts and Sciences and the departments in the Division of Biology for the past few decades as manager of the Biology Service Facility (BSF). BSF is an extremely well managed unit that serves hundreds of faculty and students. It provides fabrication and repair services that not only save the university money and time, but also permit innovative solutions that could not be found commercially. In addition, David has been an essential participant and important contributor in new building design and other activities related to the growth and development of biology research at UT. He has managed the duties of his complex position with humor and professionalism. Kim Harrison, Mary Beckley, and Bernice Koprince, Department of History, received the Outstanding Teamwork Award. Their nominators describe Kim, Mary, and Bernie as the most helpful, caring, cheerful, hardest-working, and enjoyable administrative team any department could hope to have. All three are seasoned professionals who go out of their way every day to make the lives of history faculty, students, and visitors easier. The team of three actively seek ways to improve the department   s operational efficiency and record keeping. In the words of their nominator,    Kim, Mary, and Bernie infuse a sense of fun and spirit into our daily routine and work together in an attitude of mutual respect that is beautiful to watch!    At their suggestion, some years ago the department began the process of holding a weekly administrative meeting that connects the three staff members, Kim, Mary, and Bernie, with the faculty leaders in the department (department head, associate head, and director of graduate studies). During these one-hour meetings, the group reviews every detail of department business. Kim, Bernie and Mary each bring great insight to bear, and always come up with creative solutions to the week   s challenges. They often suggest great ideas for improving the way we do our business. Their attitude has remained positive even as their workload has grown steadily each year as they have incorporated additional university and college requirements, and accommodated the needs of a larger and highly productive faculty. Before and after the awards ceremony, staff enjoyed food and games planned around a carnival theme. Refreshments included an array of tasty treats including cotton candy, popcorn, root beer floats, and hot dogs. The perfect weather and competitive spirit enticed several staff to challenge college administrators in Corn Hole, Lawn Darts, Tip- a-Troll, Quarter Back Challenge, and other games set up on the lawn. Bluegrass music was provided by Taylor Kress and Bonnie Simmons. The celebration concluded with the awarding of a number of door prizes which included gift certificates from local businesses and many VOLS items.","link":"https:\/\/artsci.utk.edu\/six-extraordinary-staff-receive-college-awards\/"},{"title":"Chancellor Recognizes Chrisanne Romeo for Extraordinary Customer Service","content":"Chancellor Recognizes Chrisanne Romeo for Extraordinary Customer Service The Extraordinary Customer Service award is given to a university employee who is consistently optimistic and serves students, faculty, staff, and campus visitors with great care. Chrisanne Romeo has worked as an administrative specialist in the Department of Physics and Astronomy for five years, long enough to inspire many letters of appreciation from students. She   s described as warm, helpful, and efficient.    She always cuts right through red tape like scissors through the ribbon of a grand opening,    writes one nominator.    I would say that if we were a family, she would be the mother,    said another grateful student. She helps to fill an enormous need within her department by helping students with emergency situations and providing accurate and timely information, as well as assistance in applications to graduate schools.

Congratulations to Ashleigh Powers, coordinator of academic advising for the Department of Psychology for your 2017 Excellence in Advising award! Powers views each advising appointment with students as a teaching and mentoring opportunity. The care she takes with students is reflected in their growth, with one undergraduate noting that Powers    created a positive and secure experience    for her. Other students praise her vast knowledge as well as her    calm and funny demeanor.    Powers has served as coordinator of academic advising for the Department of Psychology since 2013. She also teaches Careers in Psychology and the Volunteer Experience. In her role as coordinator, Powers provides regular updates on the status of psychology undergraduates at monthly faculty meetings. She has been instrumental in forging alliances between professional and faculty advisors and works extensively with student advisees, helping them to adjust to university life, plan their course schedules, and find research and internship opportunities. In 2015, Powers won the department   s Outstanding Staff Award. Congratulations to all the staff in the Department of Sociology for your role in the department   s excellence in advancing diversity and inclusion at UT and receiving the 2017 Dr. Marva Rudolph Diversity and Inter-Culturalism Unit Excellence Award. The Department of Sociology faced trying times this past year as outside forces worked to undermine UT   s commitment to diversity. Nevertheless, the department has remained a leading advocate for diversity on campus, working with student groups and individuals to raise awareness of diversity issues and support UT   s diversity institutions and personnel. The department is launching a new concentration in critical race and ethnic studies, and it organized the New Directions in Critical Criminology conference in 2017 to examine the unequal treatment of disadvantaged populations. The department   s curriculum addresses issues related to race, gender, and globalization, with faculty scholarship in areas including transformative justice, immigration, and inequities in worker conditions in global tourism. Its student body increasingly reflects its commitment to diversity  last year, 80 percent of incoming graduate students in sociology were from underrepresented groups.","link":"https:\/\/artsci.utk.edu\/2017-chancellors-honors-2\/"},{"title":"Staff Appreciation Event","content":"Staff Appreciation Event We honored outstanding staff at our annual Staff Appreciation Event May 18.

In 2013, Payton Miller walked on the UT campus and a year later began her unofficial career painting the Rock. Their worlds collided with a simple handshake May 13 during the College of Arts and Sciences 2017 commencement ceremonies. More than 900 graduates joined Miller and walked across the stage in the Thompson-Boling Arena, shaking hands with Dean Lee, Chancellor Davenport, and Astronaut Jack Schmitt, who received an honorary Doctor of Science and Humane Letters degree from the college. Schmitt addressed the graduating class and shared his experiences as an astronaut, telling graduates that his years with the Apollo program taught him that we as a country rely on young Americans to do great things. Learn more about his advice to graduates. Schmitt   s ties to UT stem from his relationship with Larry Taylor, professor of petrology and geochemistry in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences. In 1972, Taylor was in the    backroom    of the Johnson Space Center during the Apollo 17 Mission advising astronauts on the moon, which included Schmitt. Taylor, who considers himself a true    lunatic    because of his continuous study of and fascination with lunar rocks and soil, started his distinguished career at UT in 1973. His outstanding service to the college and university over the years earned him the 2017 College Marshal Award, the highest honor in the college. Read more about this honor and Professor Taylor   s career. As the unofficial painter of the Rock, Miller spent many long nights creating images of UT icons such as Smokey and Pat Summitt. Thirty paintings later, she graduated as a member of the Chancellor   s Honors Program with a degree in biochemistry.

Due to its increase in majors and popularity, the Sustainability program is now part of the Department of Geography as an undergraduate degree program. Melissa Hinten, geography lecturer, is excited about the merge and looks forward to seeing students benefit from the program in its new home within the department.    As the interdisciplinary program concentrations transition to stand-alone degree programs housed within established academic departments, students will still pursue degrees that are interdisciplinary in nature, but will have the benefit of support from academic departments,    Hinten says.    Academic departments can provide a home for students to gather and find resources, enhance recruitment and outreach for the major, provide opportunities for student networking, and provide more faculty for advising and mentoring.    The IDP known as the Women   s Studies program is now Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies program. Dedicated to the study of how gender and sexuality shape the past, present, and future of human cultures and societies, the new major is inclusive and updated for the 21st century.    The Women   s Studies program served the community well for many years, but a review of the program found that it had not kept up with the field   s growth, student interests, or new faculty on campus who were engaged in cutting-edge research,    says Lynn Sacco, professor of history and director of interdisciplinary, international, and experiential programs.    The new program captures the breadth and complications of the updated major. Students mix courses in the humanities and social sciences that treat gender, rather than race or class, as the central category of analysis.    Visit the website to learn more about this program. The Middle East Studies program officially launches this semester. The goal of this program is to provide students with interdisciplinary training in history, culture, literature, politics, languages, and religions of the Middle East. Graduates of the program will be prepared for a variety of careers related to this significant region of the world.    We are very excited to be launching the new Middle East Studies program,    says Tina Shepardson, professor of religious studies and chair of the program.    UT students will be able to take advantage of recent faculty hires to focus on this complex region of the world, which plays such a significant role in current conversations.
