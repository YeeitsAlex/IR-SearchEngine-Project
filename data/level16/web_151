      Once restricted to exotic locations like Las Vegas, Macau, and Monte Carlo, casinos are now operating in many cities nationally and internationally from the Maryland waterfront to Ho Chi Minh City. This expansion of the gaming industry, both geographically and economically, raises new and important policy questions about the role of government in gaming regulation, the obligations and opportunities for casinos, and public support for gambling and gaming tax revenue. The contributors to this book have decades of experience in gaming regulation and business and are optimistic about the future of gaming and casinos. Each author critically engages the subject and offers his or her insight into what works and what does not in the gaming business and gaming regulation. Whether a jurisdiction is considering legalizing gaming or deciding how to regulate an existing gaming industry, it should engage in a careful cost-benefit analysis informed by available data and the jurisdiction’s particular public policy goals.

      Slot machines are the backbone of most casinos. They earn the most money and determine the physical layout of the casino floor. The management of slot machines, which includes overseeing employees, selecting machines, designing the playing space, resolving customer disputes, and conducting analyses to improve operations, is a challenging field whose complexity has grown as the machines themselves have become more sophisticated.
     </p>
     <p>
      To better document the current issues in slot management—and the change the field has seen over the past four decades—the University of Nevada, Las Vegas Center for Gaming Research conducted an oral history project. Drawn from these interviews,
      <em>
       Tales from the Slot Floor
      </em>
      features slot managers discussing several of the most important issues in today’s casino world, including: the optimal layout of a slot floor; the qualities demonstrated by both good and bad managers; what customers want from their visits to the casino; the vendor/casino relationship; appealing to millennials; and what the future holds.

      Whether by court decision or legislative change, gambling’s  next expansion in the United States will be sports wagering. However, state and  federal policymakers and regulators have limited experience in addressing the  many issues that are presented by regulated sports wagering.  The challenges they will face are complicated  by the fact that sports betting is a global industry encompassing both legal  and illegal markets.
     </p>
     <p class="regular">
      This book first provides a detailed explanation of the scope  and economics of the sports wagering industry and a description of how  sportsbooks operate.  It then describes  the evolving legal landscape for sports wagering in the U.S., culminating in  the Supreme Court case that considered New Jersey’s challenge to the federal  law that has limited sports betting to the state of Nevada.

      Macao  is a large and vibrant casino market that continues to lead the world in gaming  revenues. Tables games dominate Macao gambling, which means that frontline  employees—casino dealers—have an even more central role than they do in other  jurisdictions. In this study, Carlos Siu Lam investigates the role of informal  learning processes in customer service. Four themes emerge: the importance of  informal learning to frontline employees and casinos; experiences  and processes encountered by frontline employees in their informal learning  activities; how informal learning is acquired and shared by frontline  employees; and the how casino management manages frontline employees.

      Internet gaming sparks controversy from corporate board rooms to legislative hallways. Unlike traditional casinos, the Internet permits people to engage in gaming activities from virtually anywhere over computers and mobile devices. Governments and policy makers looking at this activity struggle with such questions as whether regulation can assure that Internet gaming can be restricted to adults, the games offered are fair and honest, and players will be paid if they win. This book is a timely collection of eleven chapters discussing key considerations and model approaches to internet gaming regulation and outlining the important questions and emerging answers to regulating gaming activity outside of land-based casinos.
     </p>
     <p align="left">
      Internet gaming is an emerging field, especially in the U.S., and the contributors to this book provide regulatory examples and lessons that will be helpful to lawyers, policy makers, gaming operators and others interested in this burgeoning industry.
