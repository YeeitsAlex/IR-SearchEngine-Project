          Let’s face it, maintaining a healthy lifestyle can be hard. With so many dining options available, maintaining a proper diet is a difficult task. On top of that, the holidays come with their own set of challenges—seasonal foods that only appear once a year are too tempting to pass up.

          Two UT nutritionists, Janie Burney from UT Extension and Charlene Schmidt from UT Chattanooga, have some tips for sustaining a healthy diet, both during and after the holidays.

          1. Is it effective to count calories or should I be tracking other aspects of my diet?

          : I suggest that you start tracking everything you eat. Set a number of calories for yourself, depending on your size and physical activity, and try to stay near that number. Write it down on a daily basis. Weighing yourself once a week also will help you keep track of your progress toward losing or maintaining your weight.
         </span>

           Schmidt:
          </b>
          The number of calories needed in a person’s diet differs according to a variety of factors including gender and genetics. The type and amount of foods consumed are key. For example, there are about 150 calories in 3 cups of carrots as opposed to 150 calories in 2 teaspoons of ranch dressing. They are the same amount of calories but have big differences in quantity, so make sure you’re paying attention to the serving size when consuming your food. The type of fat being consumed is also important. A mix of both saturated fats (lard, butter and bacon) and monounsaturated fats (olive oils, canola oils and plant stanols) is desirable rather than just all of one type.

          2. With the football season underway and the holiday season approaching, how can I avoid overeating at tailgates and holiday parties?

          When you are at these types of parties, search for the fruits, vegetables and low-calorie options. If you fill yourself up on these kinds of foods, you will not overeat on the other unhealthy choices at the party.

          I know that the holiday season is filled with delicious and high calorie/high fat appetizers. Not to mention all the alcohol, which adds even more calories and can increase your hunger. I suggest trying to stay away from the buffet table and avoiding the deep-fried, heavily breaded appetizers that have high fat dressings/dips served with them. Make a conscious effort to plan out what you may be consuming ahead of time so you have a strategy to make it through the event. Eating a small nutritious snack of fruits and veggies prior to attending the event can cause hunger to subside. Consuming fluids like sparkling water with your meals or hot beverages like coffee or tea also will help reduce hunger.

          3. What are some tips for conquering cravings?
         </b>
        </p>
        <p class="p20">
         <span class="s2">
          <b>
           Burney:
          </b>
          Cravings are harder to break if they are consumed for a long period of time. I know that we all usually cave into our cravings on Thanksgiving, Christmas and other holidays and that’s okay. It’s only a few days a year, so allow yourself to eat your favorite foods. Try not to take these unhealthy foods, especially those you crave, home from a holiday gathering or party. Instead, keep fruits and vegetables cut and ready-to-eat at home. Having these options will make you reach for healthy alternatives while also keeping you fuller longer.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p class="p20">
         <span class="s1">
          <b>
           Schmidt:
          </b>
          If you are craving chocolate or a cookie, my advice is to eat it in a small amount. Take a small portion and place it in a bowl away from the entire bag of treats. If you’re unable to avoid eating the entire bag, try not purchasing it. Eating protein will also help curb the hunger. Items such as cheeses made with low fat/skim milk, Greek yogurt with fruit, cottage cheese, lean meat, garbanzo beans or black beans can all be healthy options to keep you fuller longer. However, try to find yogurts that have 16 grams of sugar or less on the label, or choose the one with zero added sugar. You also will want to add your own honey, fruit and nuts.

          In baking, it’s harder to find substitutes. You almost always have to find those recipes that are specifically written with healthy eating in mind. However, with flour, you can substitute up to half of what the recipe called for with whole grains, adding more fiber to the recipe. You also can substitute sugar with non-caloric sweeteners like Truvia or Splenda. Fruit is also a good option for added sweetness because of their natural sugars.

          Many recipes with substitutes call for black beans in burgers, avocado in brownies or applesauce in cakes to replace the fat. Keep in mind that the end result might not taste the same or have the same texture or fluffiness, but sometimes people find that the flavor is surprisingly excellent or even better.

         <em>
          by Shelley Cannioto
         </em>
        </p>
        <p>
         I have been lucky enough to travel and live overseas for a number of years. I loved almost everything about it and was fascinated to compare attitudes, lifestyles, and habits of other cultures to what I had always experienced in America. I met my husband while I was living in England. He is Italian so I moved to Italy shortly before we were married. Italians have a knack for always looking beautiful and slim despite having a passionate love of food!
        </p>
        <p>
         My first holiday season was one of wonder, to say the least. In Italy, Christmas is not actually the largest ‘feast’. They have seven (SEVEN!) food-centered holidays in total which begin on December 8, then you have Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and Santo Stefano (Dec. 26). You rest a few days before celebrating New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day. The last feast is on January 7. I felt like I was suffering a delicious but uncomfortable death! All the mamas and nonnas spent days preparing their most delicious dishes and fully expected you to enjoy every morsel. We spent several hours around the table talking, eating and laughing. It was amazing. But I started to wonder if any of my clothes would fit after all of these multiple course meals. Each meal typically consisted of a charcuterie plate, pasta, risotto, meat, vegetables, bread, fruit, nuts, desserts, and alcohol!
        </p>
        <p>
         Sadly, I was not blessed with a fast metabolism and have to watch everything I eat. I was curious as to how these slim people could eat like this and not really gain weight. Italians not only pay very close attention to how much they eat but also to the quality of their food. They opt for fresh food almost 100% of the time, which is important to note.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, I would say the trick to ward off weight gain is how they eat
         <u>
          after
         </u>
         the holidays. Six days a week you will find live cooking shows on TV, which usually last a few hours. This was not a surprise since Italians love to cook and love to eat! After the holidays on January 8th, I turned on the TV not really looking forward to watching two hours of cooking. I was tired of eating, I was tired of food, and I was well overfed. But there was nothing else to watch so on the TV went. That day a dietician was introduced to the audience. I would learn over the next few years that she is a regular on the program every January. She gave advice daily for one week. What she taught changed how I approached the holidays. She said that it is important to give your body and digestive system a break. The break is temporary, lasting only a few days and you can decide how long you need. During those days, focus on eating basic foods. For instance, eat simple things like toast or plain yogurt for breakfast, minestrone or other broth soup for lunch, fruit for dessert, herbal teas, and a lot of green vegetables. The meals should be light and easy to digest. Also, you are less likely to be tempted to overeat.
        </p>
        <p>
         I love the simplicity of the approach and typically use this in my life. This attitude helped me to change my habits during and after the holidays. Rather than eating food I may not want, I focus on what I do want and try to choose things that were fresh. I do not beat myself up over what I did eat or how much I ate; instead, I chose to start afresh with lighter foods that I enjoy just for a little while. Celebrations are important! But so is balance. We may not be able to avoid gaining a little weight in the holidays, but I see no reason to let that weight stay with me and think there is a pain-free, healthy way to avoid it.

        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left">
         My significant other quit smoking five years ago – November 16, 2012 – precisely one week after we reconnected. He’d been a smoker for 40 years – the same number of years we’d not seen each other. (Yeah, we’re one of those couples that found each other on social media.) He was a recent Floridian transplant to the Mid-South. I was living in Texas. Anyways, if you ask him, he says the key to his quitting was jolly ranchers – the watermelon, grape, &amp; sour apple variety by the bagful. Our first year of courtship was a commuting one, and jolly ranchers served as a chaperone on our dates. They were a habitual presence. Every two, three, or four weeks, we’d meet up in east Texas – the geographical mid-point for us. I’d bring jolly ranchers. He’d bring jolly ranchers. We’d shop for jolly ranchers. On occasion, we’d have to “hunt” for jolly ranchers. It was those times that salvation was often found in a still wrapped, albeit sticky hot flavorful mess, underneath a car floorboard. I don’t know how he determined that jolly ranchers were his ticket to success. He’s an unconventional guy, and he had an unconventional method. It had to have been so difficult, but he quit. In hindsight, I wonder how he managed during those interim weeks we were apart. He was alone. He had no tangible support. It’s still hard for me to discern because he never talks about it. Ever. I was living alone in another geographical state, and he was living alone in a bit of a mental state. I do know he quit smoking around smokers. At that time, it was part of his occupational culture. Other than jolly ranchers, his other prime ploy was going to the designated smoking areas, and, pardon the pun, blowing smoke at his peers. He’d sit in their mist, literally, and taunt them to puff their exhaust in his face. That had to have been intense, but he says it was a way of continuing to belong within his coworkers’ inner circle.
        </p>
        <p>
         The more time has passed, the more I appreciate the significance of his quitting. Recent google stats say seventy percent of smokers want to quit, but only six percent succeed. He’s shared he could pick up a cigarette every day. He’s shared he has to quit every day. I appreciate more and more the wider world’s smokers’ struggles in quitting, and shame on me for taking a sanctimonious stance on our second date. (I had issued him a “quit me or quit them” proclamation.)
        </p>
        <p>
         My significant other &amp; I are pushing sixty. We’re older. We’re wiser. We’re darn cute together, but I don’t think either one of us realized that this one single step – his compelling decision to quit smoking was, decidedly, the most important undertaking to a better life for the both of us. We’re living a happy little life in northern Mississippi, and I give him most of the credit. While he’s had a wildly successful five-year run, I’m pledging to do a better job at empathizing with those who, every day, are trying to quit.
        </p>
        <p>
         I work at a health science center – one that includes several trauma hospitals. Ironically, there are designated outdoor smoke areas. I have a newfound compassion for most of those smokers. They deal mightily with many psychological &amp; physiological dynamics – addiction &amp; withdrawal. I imagine these smokers I see are also coping with a loved one’s physical suffering and pain. Why else would they openly smoke in this multi-hospital environment? I used to identify people as smokers versus nonsmokers. I used to reel from second-hand smoke. Now, because of my beloved, I just viscerally sense the second-hand struggle. For them, every day is a smoking gun. For me, every day is a frame of mind.

         For many of us, summer is the time to kick back, relax, and immerse ourselves in a new book!  I’m a pretty eclectic reader. If the writing is good, I’m not too particular about the genre.  I thought I would share some of my favorites that cover the spectrum – from non-fiction to horror and everything in between.  Whether you are looking for a good beach read or something to help you relax during your staycation, I certainly hope this list puts you on the trail of a new favorite summer read!

         I read this book last summer on a cruise, and I immediately fell in love with the main character, Flavia de Luce. She is a precocious, 11-year-old chemist who solves murders in the surrounding area of her family’s crumbling estate. I love the setting of the book – 1950s British countryside. The writing was excellent, the characters were quirky and unique, and the story was told in a compelling manner that made me want to keep reading!

         I read this book a couple of years ago when Jurassic World was released in theaters. It was the perfect book to read by the pool. If you’ve seen the movie, don’t discount reading the book. There are some startling differences that still allow for it to be a new experience. The characters and the story itself are fascinating, and the non-stop action kept me reading long into a sunburn!

         I listened to this while driving to the beach on a recent vacation. Audiobooks are a great way to keep kids (and adults) occupied on long drives. The story is based on the premise that ghosts are walking the earth and some of them are
         <u>
          very
         </u>
         dangerous. However, only children and teenagers can see them, which means that children are basically the ghost law enforcement protecting everyone else. The story focuses around one organization and its efforts to remove a ghost from a home. The dialogue is witty, and the plot is awesome! I’m not always a big fan of Young Adult novels (they can feel like “same story, different setting” at times), but I really felt like this was a unique story that was well crafted.

         <em>

         still terrifies me if I think about it too long. However, Stephen King is one of my all-time favorite authors. I can put up with the fact that his books scare me because I love almost everything about his writing style. If you’ve ever read
         <em>
          Dracula
         </em>
         , then you will love this book. Stephen King loved
         <em>
          Dracula
         </em>
         so this is sort of like a modernized version of the classic. The story is definitely creepy, but the plot is so intriguing that you’ll want to keep reading.

         I stumbled onto this book by chance while visiting a friend in Philadelphia.  I had heard about the Mutter Museum located there, but I had no idea who “Mutter” was. I wasn’t able to visit the museum, so I decided to Google him, and I stumbled across this book. It turns out he was an incredible man who was an advocate for compassionate medicine in a time where a lot of medical practices were just a few steps away from barbaric. The book follows the life of Dr. Mutter, and it reveals his impact on the world of modern medicine. Whether or not you typically gravitate towards non-fiction, this is a compelling read that shows how one man’s hard work paved the way for changes in how doctors treat patients.

         <em>
          by Melissa Powell
         </em>
        </p>
        <p>
         In a few weeks, I will be traveling out of state with another family for one week. There will be seven children, ages 6 months to 7 years old, and 4 adults. Today we found out our hotel does not have a refrigerator. Now the other mom and I are on a mission to feed our kids without compromising good nutrition and wise spending habits. I have been a registered dietitian nutritionist for over 15 years and real life scenarios like this one still test me. The fact is, the Standard American Diet, or SAD for short, makes this task difficult. Challenge accepted!
        </p>
        <p>
         Like any good American mom, my first step was to Google “unrefrigerated healthy meals” and found out I had a lot of options if I wanted to feed my kids in space, on a boat, or in the wilderness. There are actually some really great ready to eat meals that don’t compromise good nutrition.
         <a href="http://gopicnic.com/">
          Go Picnic
         </a>
         was one brand that caught my attention. However, this may not be an option for picky eaters or families on a tight budget.
        </p>
        <p>
         Step two: consider foods within each group that doesn’t require refrigeration. Fruits, like apples, oranges, and bananas; grains, like whole wheat bread and crackers; and, proteins, like seeds, nuts, and nut butters all came to mind quite easily. Vegetables were more of a challenge. The food pouches that have become popular may be a good option for this food group, and worth the extra dollars for the sake of ease of travel and some extra vitamins. Another option is to load up on the veggies during the first few days when we have coolers. Peppers, celery, cucumbers, and snap peas all make for great snacking options.
        </p>
        <p>
         Step three: consider foods for each meal and snack. Breakfast will likely consist of an oatmeal bar or cookie and fresh fruit. There are some wonderful recipes for hearty, healthy oatmeal or granola bars online. Lunch may include a veggie pouch with either a peanut butter sandwich or crackers and jerky. A seed, nut, dried fruit mix will make great snacks. Again, online recipes abound for snack mixes. And children make great chefs when it comes to these types of recipes. So, this will be their job, while I pack the car.
        </p>
        <p>
         The reminder for us all with this challenge is that planning will make all the difference, in keeping within a budget and filling up on healthy, great-tasting foods. Taking a few extra minutes to plan a menu and a shopping list will save us time, money, and energy (literally, we will have more energy from the real foods chosen, rather than processed or fast foods that often leave us tired and rundown). So, wherever you travel this summer, I hope you will accept the challenge to plan and choose nutritious foods.

         A Lover’s Discourse: Fragments, Roland Barthes (1977)
        </p>
        <p>
         A structuralist meditation on love, in the
         <br/>
         form of short entries, alphabetically arranged by topic. Dense with allusion and the trappings of theory, yet somehow still recognizable.

         Shards of Honour, Lois McMaster Bujold (1986)
        </p>
        <p>
         I read this book at least once a year. Military science fiction and romance, can’t get any better than that!

         ZOO or Letters Not about Love, Victor Shklovsky (1923)
        </p>
        <p>
         An epistolary novel. Exiled in Berlin, Shklovsky falls madly in love with a woman who allows him to send her letters on the sole condition that they not be about love. His constant correspondence covers topics ranging from art to philosophy to history, though his unrequited feelings are constantly bubbling under the surface.

         If on a Winter’s Night a Traveler, Italo Calvino (1979)
        </p>
        <p>
         A ground-breaking, self-referential, postmodern narrative. You are one of two book lovers who develop a relationship while on a quest to find the end of a book named If on a Winter’s Night a Traveler…, which is the story of you, one of two lovers who develop a relationship while on a quest…

         <em>
          by Lauren Moret
         </em>
        </p>
        <p>
         It’s not easy making a transition in your work life. All of us do it at various times in our career: take on new job responsibilities or job roles; change departments or work schedules; get behind in our work tasks and need to play catch up; or, face the well-known monster of imposter syndrome. I’ve experienced all of these concepts of change, discomfort, and insecurity over the last three years since completing a graduate program and moving to Tennessee to begin a new job in a new profession here at UT (I teach research methods on the Knoxville campus).
        </p>
        <p>
         Since my arrival, I’ve lost countless hours of sleep worrying about if my lesson plan for the next day’s class was “good enough” or if my annual review paperwork would be formatted and provided to the tenured faculty in a way that made me look like a commodity worth keeping around in the department (Notice the language I use when talking about myself in this context. I am such a hard-working human being, so of course, I’m worth keeping around! But, the academic work environment can be tough…we are compared to colleagues, peer institutions, and regardless of the work we do with students, the pubs have to hit!). I’d like to report that these lost hours of sleep have led to greater productivity overall, but I can’t. My hours spent awake between 2-5am have led to nothing further than my binging on Netflix and Hulu. (I’m caught up on several shows now.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Everyone should understand it is normal to feel imposter syndrome or anxious about your work. It’s a sign that you are a cut above the rest; you hold yourself to a high standard; you have expectations for yourself, and that’s ok. Many of my thoughts that make me anxious can be turned into a positive. For example, I sometimes worry about a lesson being “smart enough” for my advanced level, doctoral seminars. Now, I am eight semesters into my work at UT, and I have never had a single student complain that the content wasn’t challenging enough for them. If anything, the students show excitement by the exposure to new materials. Though I typically over plan, and we don’t cover everything assigned in the lesson, I end up leaving the students at a comfortable stopping place while giving them ideas of how they can continue their thinking and writing as they move forward.
        </p>
        <p>
         I recently checked in with a former UT Chancellor’s Teaching Award in Excellence winner and learned that what I was doing was succession planning, which means setting students up for success in their next steps as independent scholars. Without realizing it, a concept that had made me so anxious it caused me to lose sleep turned out to be something that works in my favor, a method that supports my goal of becoming an excellent college professor. I needed a new perspective on my skills and abilities. I needed to fall back on trusting myself because I know how to do this work. I say to myself in my head, “you know this, you got this.”
        </p>
        <p>
         I know the talking I do with myself in my own head needs to be positive and supportive, even though this is easy to forget. And while the imposter syndrome and anxiety visit from time to time, I’m getting better about acknowledging the thoughts as no more than that…just thoughts and not true descriptors about me. So now when I wake up at 2:40 am, I roll over and just go back to sleep. (Turns out, I’m a better teacher when I have a healthy night’s sleep, but that’s a conversation for another time.) You can overcome imposter syndrome and anxious feelings about the job too by believing in yourself, talking positively in your own head about the work you do, and by giving yourself the “Okay” to just be.

         <em>
          By Andrew Bailey
         </em>
        </p>
        <p>
         Despite working in the department of Health and Human Performance, I’m not a devoted exerciser. That feels like a dark confession in a time where physical activity is at its lowest, with the Southeastern United States reporting the least leisure time physical activity of any region in the country (c.f.
         <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/data/">
          https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/data/
         </a>
         ). I feel bad about it. I wish I liked to run more, or that I could get excited about an aerobics class the way my wife does. Each time I begin a workout with the expressed intent of exercising, I find myself counting down the minutes until I can be done. Yes, I feel good afterward, but that doesn’t take away the memory of the pain I endured to get there. That memory typically prevents me from returning, at least for a while.
        </p>
        <p>
         I suspect that I’m not alone in my distaste for working out. There is very little in a packaged workout experience that inspires me, and the goal of extending my life a few years is pretty vague and abstract to serve as a motivator. I’m the guy that personal trainers hope they never encounter.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are, however, active things I do enjoy. I love playing outdoors. I love taking my 5-year-old daughter on hikes and looking for treasures in the form of rocks, leaves, and twigs that will inevitably end up in my pockets and in the laundry. I love taking a new way to the coffee shop and seeing a new street, and I love exploring trails, rivers, mountains, and anything else I can wander into. Because of the joy I derive from these things, I rarely notice the physical activity required to do them. When the mountains call and serious effort is required to explore a more demanding project, the inspiration typically overpowers the dread of a grueling approach. I’ve come to realize that I’m not just lazy and out of shape. I’m overworked and under-inspired.
        </p>
        <p>
         Positive psychologists tell us that focusing on a negative behavior only induces more negative behaviors (Seligman, 2011). Asking yourself why you are so unhappy only makes you more unhappy. I believe the same is true with physical and mental health. We need to quit asking why we don’t work out more as if more time on a treadmill will solve our problems. Instead, we need to consider how to put ourselves in the path of inspiration. What sounds fun and exciting to you? What would you enjoy doing even if you weren’t counting the calories or mandated minutes of moderate exercise?
        </p>
        <p>
         It’s true that our bodies weren’t designed to be sedentary, nor are they built to remain in climate-controlled, concrete block spaces for 95% of our day (Mayer &amp; Frantz, 2004). Our minds function at a higher state when our bodies are active (Medina, 2014). Our bodies are most alive when the senses are engaged. Most of our built environments (classrooms and office spaces) are designed for efficiency, not for optimal human performance. Natural environments have consistently been shown to be more conducive to physical activity, to restore mental capacities depleted by work, and to reduce anxiety (Taylor &amp; Kuo, 2009). There is something inherently inspiring, restorative, and activating about the natural world.
        </p>
        <p>
         I will submit the idea that I’m more outdoorsy than some. The research cited, though, was not conducted on outdoorsy people. It would appear that humans have an inherent connection to the natural environment, either through having evolved in it or through a preference for living things (e.g. Biophilia).
        </p>
        <p>
         The next time you dread the idea of trudging through another forced march, consider a change of mentality. Instead of dutifully enduring 30 minutes of vigorous activity, explore a new trail, try out paddleboarding or choose from a host of other activities that you may enjoy enough to forget about your heart rate. Walk a new, maybe longer route to the coffee shop at work, and be sure to extend it through that park a few blocks down. If your work environment isn’t conducive to short jaunts, you might get the same benefits as a weekend warrior (c.f.
         <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/09/health/weekend-exercise-benefits/">
          http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/09/health/weekend-exercise-benefits/
         </a>
         ). Let your body do what it was designed for, and put your mind in a place that nurtures it. You may find that the recommendation of 150 minutes of physical activity each week is not nearly enough of what you enjoy.

         <em>
          By Marisa A. Colston, Ph.D., ATC
         </em>
        </p>
        <p>
         The benefits of weight lifting are numerous and range from burning fat to the improvement of mental health, heart health and bone health.  Weight lifting can also minimize back pain, especially the pain and stiffness resulting from sitting at a desk all day. However, protecting your back while lifting weights is important, particularly if you have a history of back pain.  Previous low back injury presents a 3-6 times greater risk of future injury. Guidelines for the management of back pain consistently recommend staying physically active and avoiding bed rest. But how do you do so, without further aggravating the back pain?
        </p>
        <p>
         Many back problems are worsened by poor training programs, where the cause of injury is unknowingly incorporated into the lifting technique.  The most frequent contributing factors to back injury in lifting weights include extreme flexion (hyperflexion), extreme extension (hyperextension), and rotation (torsion).  Hyperflexion occurs when the low back is allowed to round, and then the weight is jerked up; e.g., rows, dead-lifts, and bent barbell rows.  Hyperextension places excessive compression on the posterior aspects of the vertebrae. Thus, exercises such as the bench press, unsupported overhead press, power clean, ballistic back extensions, prone leg curls, and squats must be used with caution and supervised closely.  Rotational or twisting-type activities frequently occur in combination with flexion or extension, which places the spine in an extremely vulnerable position.
        </p>
        <p>
         Numerous exercise programs emphasize training the core. The core is comprised of the low back, pelvis, and hips. Muscles around the core function differently than arm and leg muscles, and therefore should be trained differently.  Core muscles function to brace the trunk during motion, acting more as stabilizers, than movement generators.  Initial exercise can be done with just your body weight and then resistance can be added to increase the challenge.  Planking exercises are an excellent way to work multiple muscle groups without high loads to the spine. A forward plank requires weight bearing through the forearms and toes, with the body maintained in a horizontal position elevated above the ground. A side plank is performed with legs extended and feet and hips resting on the ground and stacked on top of each other. The elbow is placed under the shoulder to prop up the torso. Then the core is contracted and the hips and knees are lifted off the floor (perform on both sides).  Plank exercises can be held for 10-30 seconds, gradually working up to a minute.
        </p>
        <p>
         For dynamic (movement) exercise, power should be generated through the hips which is transmitted through a contracted core. This is quite different from challenging the core muscles, such as the abdominal muscles, through repeated spine flexion or rotation, which is not a good way to train the core.  Activities that emphasize a push, pull, lift or carry enhance hip power generation through a stiffened core. Programs should incorporate exercises that fulfill these tasks, rather than isolating specific muscles of the abdomen or back which create ‘energy leaks’ through bending. More motion in the back may increase injury risk.  Strength without control increases the risk for injury, as well as a lack of endurance to repeatedly execute movements with perfect form.
        </p>
        <p>
         An important point to remember is that the intervertebral disc, and the spine in general, has only a limited number of bends before damage occurs.  These bends should not be used up in exercise programs. This requires creative exercise design to challenge the trunk and core, without excessive flexion, extension, or rotation.  Unfortunately, there are currently no validated guidelines for lifting volume.  We simply do not know ‘how much weight is too heavy’ or’ how many lifts are too many’. What is known, however, is that the risk of lifting-related back injury increases as the demands (load and frequency) of the task increase. Increases in load elevates spine and intervertebral disc compression forces. In the work setting, the load is one of the strongest risk factors for low back injury. This risk increases substantially when movement mechanics are not optimal.
        </p>
        <p>
         Finally, the presence of muscles imbalances should be addressed before jumping into a weight training program. For example, an individual who has tight hip flexor muscles will frequently have weak hip extensor (gluteal) muscles. This is a concern because if the gluteal muscles are weak and inhibited, the likelihood to overcompensate by using the hamstring muscles to extend the hip increase, thereby increasing the possibility of a hamstring injury. When muscle imbalances exist, it is important to first stretch the muscles that are tight before strengthening the muscles that are weak. Obtaining full motion of tight muscles ensures that the strength aspect of the program will not occur in a limited range of motion.
        </p>
        <p>
         Weight lifting and strengthening exercises can help reduce back pain, but avoid focusing on just the muscles of the back. Resistance exercises that include the core, arm and leg muscles will lead to overall body strength which will help to reduce back pain and reduce the risk of back injury.

         </em>
        </p>
        <p>
         Did you make a New Year’s Resolution this month?  Even if you did not formally announce it or frame it as a resolution, perhaps you still had thoughts of exercising more, eating better, quitting smoking or getting more sleep.  According to statisticbrain.com, over half of Americans make New Year’s Resolutions and the most popular resolution is to lose weight or eat healthier.  Despite all these resolutions, nearly 50% of people fail to carry out these behavior changes beyond the end of January! So how do you stop yourself from joining this statistic?
        </p>
        <p>
         There are a number of theories (Bandura, 1989; Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985; Prochaska &amp; Velicer, 1997) discussing what it is that makes people stick with health behavior changes, but they have many common threads. Among these is to identify WHY you are making the change, what barriers or supports are in your environment, and tracking your progress.  Below are some tips for sticking with your goals this year:
        </p>
        <ol>
         <li>
          <strong>
           Know your “Why.”
          </strong>
          If you know your “Why” you will find your “How.” Spend some time to really think about why you are trying to make this change. What benefits do you expect to see if you are successful?  What will happen if you fail?  How does this change affect those around you? The answer to this question is different for everyone.  While it sounds good to say that you are going to eat healthier because you want to lower your cholesterol, if the truth is that you just want your spouse to stop nagging you, own it!
         </li>
         <li>
          <strong>
           Adjust if needed.
          </strong>
          Maybe your original goal was to go to the gym five days a week but you’ve been struggling to make it just two nights a week. Cut yourself a break and acknowledge that two is more than zero! It is better to back off a bit than to quit completely.
         </li>
         <li>
          <strong>
           Identify barriers.
          </strong>
          This goes along with #2. What are the things that made it hard to hit your 5 day/week goal? Maybe you’re more likely to make it to the gym if you go in the morning because work or family commitments tend to eat up more time than expected in the evening. Perhaps you struggle with your healthy eating or smoking cessation goal in certain social situations. Identifying these triggers will help you to plan for them.
         </li>
         <li>
          <strong>
           Find your support.
          </strong>
          There’s a wealth of research (and personal experience!) showing that people are more likely to stick with behavior changes, especially exercise if they are receiving social support. This be a friend who meets you at the gym, a group exercise class where you make friends and people will notice if you miss, or just sharing regular updates with a friend or on social media to hold yourself accountable.
         </li>
         <li>
          <strong>
           Track, track, track
          </strong>
          . Keep track of your progress, including notes about what worked and what didn’t. This can be a reward in itself when you look back at the end of the week and see how much time you spent at the gym or how many vegetables you ate! Adding notes about what you enjoyed or tricks and tips that helped you stick to your goal each day will be good reminders when you struggle in the future.
         </li>
         <li>
          <strong>
           Reward yourself!
          </strong>
          While better health is certainly a reward on its own, sometimes we want something more immediate and more tangible. It is ok to reward yourself sometimes for your hard work! Make a contract with yourself to treat yourself to a new workout outfit or a new pair of shoes after 15 trips to the gym. Buy yourself that awesome new dinner set to eat all your healthy food off of when you stick to your meal plan.  Just be sure your reward doesn’t negate all your hard work! A scoop of ice cream for hitting your target at the gym is great – an entire gallon just spoils all that effort!
         </li>
         <li>
          Most importantly,
          <strong>
           find what works for you!
          </strong>
          Your initial goal may not be going as planned, but that’s no reason to quit.  Evaluate your plan, make changes as necessary and keep working at it!
