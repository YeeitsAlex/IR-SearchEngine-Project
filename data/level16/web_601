    The web deactivation feature is provided as a way for you to immediately deactivate your Aggie Card in the event that your card is lost or stolen.
    By deactivating your Aggie Card online you will be "turning off" all functions of your Aggie Card. You must come in person to the Aggie Card Office
    (General Services Complex, Suite 2801) to replace or reactivate your Aggie Card/account. Click the button below if you are sure you want to
    deactivate your Aggie Card.
