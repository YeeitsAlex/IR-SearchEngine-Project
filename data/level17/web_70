                 Welcome to the Department of Food Science. We are the only food science program in the state and offer comprehensive programs giving our students a strong mix of theoretical knowledge and hands-on experiences. Our faculty’s research programs further the understanding of the food safety, physicochemical, sensory, quality, health and engineering properties of  foods.   A strong interface with our stakeholders allow us to transfer science-based best practices to the food and beverage industry, government agencies, and entrepreneurs to help meet the goals of providing safe, nutritious and high quality foods.

Are you interested in improving the safety of the world   s food supply? Do you like science and or engineering? When you finish college do you want to have a career that pays well and is rewarding? If you answered    yes    to any of these questions, then perhaps Food Science is the right major for you. A food scientist applies chemistry, microbiology, engineering, and other sciences to the production, processing, preservation, evaluation, and distribution of food products. Food scientists help to ensure the availability of safe, convenient, desirable, and nutritious foods for the world s consumers. In terms of value of shipments, food processing is the largest manufacturing industry in the United States. Graduates of the UT Food Science program have career options in a variety of food industries, such as those producing dairy, meat, fruit, vegetable and cereal products. There are many employment opportunities, including positions in new product research and development, quality assurance and quality control, production management, marketing, food flavor chemistry, microbiological food safety, food engineering, and sensory evaluation. There also are positions in state and Federal governments for food safety and quality inspection. The demand for food science graduates by the food industry and regulatory agencies exceeds the available supply. Food science-related careers are among the top job prospects in the US and internationally. Salaries are highly competitive and are in line with professional degree subject areas. The national average starting salary for food science graduates with B.S. degree is in the $40,000-$60,000 range. Curriculum Students majoring in Food Science   follow a curriculum leading to a science concentration or a pre-professional concentration. These curricula prepare students to apply basic scientific and business principles to manufacturing, processing, distribution and utilization of food products that meet the needs and desires of consumers. Course work emphasizes the basic principles of converting raw food materials into safe, acceptable consumer products. Course information on food commodities details processing of specific types of food products such as bakery, fruit and vegetable, dairy, and meat products. Students entering the program should have an interest in the sciences, such as chemistry, microbiology, and biology.   Curricula for the pre-professional and science concentrations are similar, and differ slightly with regard to the level and number of basic science requirements. Students pursuing the pre-professional and science concentrations can earn the B.S. degree in Food Science after completion of the respective four-year programs. Additionally, the pre-professional curriculum allows students to be awarded the B.S. degree after three years in FST and the successful completion of the first year (two semesters) in an approved dental, medical or pharmacy program or the UT College of Veterinary Medicine. Although a B.S. degree is not required for admission to the Colleges of Dentistry or Medicine, most students accepted into these programs have earned a baccalaureate degree before admission. A B.S. degree also can be obtained before enrolling in a Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) program. Non-majors can earn a minor in Food Science  by taking 16 hours of prescribed courses in the department.    Faculty The department s diverse and well trained faculty is committed to providing quality education for all students in the program. Areas of expertise include food chemistry, food engineering, food microbiology, food processing, and sensory evaluation. In addition, faculty interests include fruits and vegetables, meat products, and cereal and bakery products. The majority of departmental faculty members have won outstanding teaching and or research awards. As a freshman or transfer, each student is assigned a faculty advisor to help with program planning and career decisions. Advisors are readily available for these activities and can provide information on employment, internships, and financial aid opportunities.    Facilities Students in Food Science have access to up-to-date food chemistry and food microbiologylaboratories and specialized equipment for food processing and evaluation. Upon completion of a new Food Science Building, there will be specialized areas for processing fruits and vegetables, meat products, and bakery products. There is a computerized sensory evaluation laboratory used for both teaching and research. Students also are exposed to commercial food processing and handling operations via field trips and industry field experiences during their courses of study. The  UT College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources  provides students with a campus area that houses all the agricultural classrooms as well as a separate library that offers collections and services for agriculture,  veterinary medicine, and related biological sciences. Internet access is available in all classrooms and laboratories.   Extracurricular Activities The Food Science Club is an integral part of the department and is an affiliate of the Student Association of the professional society of food science, the Institute of Food Technologists (IFT). The club provides students with an opportunity to develop personal and professional relationships with fellow students, faculty, and people in the food industry. Through its annual fund-raising programs, the club helps support various projects such as travel to professional meetings, meat and dairy judging teams, field trips, seminars, and social activities. Undergraduate students have the unique opportunity of participating in laboratory research projects with faculty and graduate students. Students can then participate in undergraduate research paper competitions on campus and at meetings of various professional organizations. Students may compete in the annual IFT Student Association College Bowl competition where UT is in the Midwest region with universities from Kentucky, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio. Active involvement in the Club and professional organizations offers students opportunities to develop leadership potential on both a local and national level. Students may also participate in departmental activities. The Department sponsors Dairy Products and Meat Judging teams which travel and compete with students from other universities. Team members have opportunities to tour dairy and meat processing companies during their travel. Involvement with judging teams allows students to increase their expertise in food science while receiving academic credit. The Department provides assistance and opportunities for students to participate in travel abroad. For example, past travel experiences have included study tours of Mexico, Thailand, Jamaica, Sweden, France, Germany, and Ghana. Additionally, students assist with departmental recruiting activities and career fairs on and off campus. Students are encouraged to participate in internships with food industry organizations, usually during the summer semester. At UT, there are numerous leisure and educational activities available, including sports clubs, intramural sports, fraternities and sororities, and religious organizations. Participation in extracurricular activities is encouraged.    Admissions All applicants must meet the general University requirements for admission listed in the  UT Undergraduate Catalog.

Accelerated Five Year BS-MS Program, Food Science Major For qualified students, the Department of Food Science offers an accelerated 5-year BS MS program with a BS major in Food Science and a thesis-based MS major in Food Science. Central to this program is that a qualified student may take up to 9 credit hours of approved graduate courses for their senior undergraduate electives and have them count toward both the BS degree and the MS degree. Students will be considered for conditional admission to the program during, or immediately following junior year of undergraduate study at UT.   Because the MS program requires that students write a thesis based on their original research, students in BS MS program must start working on their research project not later than immediately following junior year of undergraduate studies. For each student in the program, a graduate advisory committee composed of a minimum of three faculty members must be established before completion of BS degree. To be considered for conditional admission to the program  A student must be a declared Food Science major with a minimum GPA of 3.4, must have completed at least 15 credit hours of Food Science courses, and must have completed at least 90 credit hours of the 120 credit hours of coursework required for the BS degree with a major in Food Science. A student must provide three letters of recommendation and complete a personal interview with individuals comprising the Graduate and Undergraduate Committees in the Department of Food Science. A student must obtain a commitment from a Food Science graduate research faculty member to serve as their graduate mentor-advisor (i.e., major professor) and at least two other graduate research faculty members to serve on their graduate advisory committee. Applicants are required to have completed FDSC 241 - Food Preservation and Packaging. The Department may consider other relevant factors such as an applicant s work experience and level of maturity before conditionally admitting a student to the BS MS program. Conditional admission of a student into the 5-year BS MS program must be approved by both the Department of Food Science and the Graduate School. Students will be typically informed of the outcome of their application before the beginning of their senior year of undergraduate study. Any course taken for graduate credit before satisfying all requirements for the BS degree must be approved both by the Graduate Director and by the Graduate School. These courses must be identified in advance, in consultation with the undergraduate advisor, proposed master s graduate advisor, and advisory committee members. UT s Senior Privilege rule imposes a maximum limit of 9 credit hours on the number of graduate-level credit hours that an undergraduate student may complete before completing an undergraduate degree and being formally admitted to the Graduate School. The form  Senior Requesting Graduate Credit  is found on the Graduate School website and must be completed, signed, and submitted to the Graduate School for approval and processing. Conditional admission into the BS MS program does not guarantee acceptance into either the Graduate School or the MS program. Students in the BS MS program must apply for admission to the Graduate School and to the MS program during their senior year of undergraduate study, following the same procedures of all other student applicants. A GRE score must be submitted as part of the application for admission into any graduate program in the Department of Food Science. Students will be fully admitted to the MS program after they have been accepted both by the Graduate School and by the Food Science Department. Students will not be eligible for graduate assistantships until they are enrolled as graduate-level students in the Graduate School.","link":"http:\/\/foodscience.tennessee.edu\/master-of-science\/"},{"title":"Graduate Certificate in Food Safety","content":"Graduate Certificate in Food Safety The Department of Public Health (College of Education, Health, and Human Sciences, UTK) and the Department of Food Science (College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources, UTIA) jointly offer a Graduate Certificate in Food Safety to prepare public health and food industry leaders, researchers, educators, and practitioners to understand and apply knowledge and skills to enhance food safety and prevent food-related disease.

Mission Statement To improve food safety and quality through fundamental and applied research  prepare graduates for careers in the global food industry or health profession  deliver effective outreach education to citizens of Tennessee and beyond. History On July 1, 1972, Dr. Webster Pendergrass, Vice President for Agriculture, announced the formation of a new department called Food Technology and Science (FT&S). This new unit combined all teaching, research, and extension operations in the Institute of Agriculture (UTIA) that were related to foods into a single department. The initial faculty members were drawn from the Departments of Dairy, Animal Husbandry Vet Science, and Food Technology. Dr. J.T. Miles, Head of the Dairy Department, was appointed to lead the new group. Faculty included Dr. Jimmy L. Collins and Dr. Melvin Johnston (Food Technology), Dr. Curtis C. Melton and Dr. William R. Backus (Meat Science), Dr. Bobby J. Demott, Dr. Woodrow W. Overcast, and Dr. Hugh O. Jaynes (Dairy),       and Dr. J. Orvin Mundt (Microbiology). Extension Specialists were Mr. Herbert C. Holt (Dairy Products), Dr. Frank D. Kirkpatrick (Meats), and Mr. Ivon E. McCarty (General Food Processing). Departmental facilities included McLeod Hall, part of McCord Hall, and the UT Creamery (now the Food Safety and Processing Building). For many years the U.T. Creamery was the source of milk and dairy products for UT. Mr. Herman Carringer was the manager until his retirement in December 1983. Mr. Tommy Burch took over as manager in March 1984. Due to financial constraints, the Creamery was closed in the fall of 1989. One of the first tasks when the department was formed in 1972 was to develop curricula for B.S. and M.S. programs. Undergraduate requirements were developed to meet those required to meet Institute of Food Technologists guidelines. Undergraduate programs are approved by the Higher Education Review Board of the Institute of Food Technologists (the professional society of food science and technology). The original B.S. curriculum satisfied the requirements and the program has remained on the approved list since, with the latest approval being received in 2009. Soon after its formation, the department began work for a Ph.D. program. A proposal for a Ph.D. program in FT&S was drafted in 1974, approved by the College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources and sent forward for approval by the Graduate School. The process was long, complicated, and required many revisions. With the arrival of Dr. C. W. Minkel as Dean of The Graduate School, the proposal moved quickly and was inaugurated fall quarter 1981. The curriculum was revised significantly in 1988 when the University of Tennessee moved to the semester system. The University of Tennessee Department of Food Science and Technology is the only food science department at any university in the state of Tennessee.

Jaynes,    The First Twenty Years   , 1992) Faculty On July 1, 1972, Dr. Webster Pendergrass, Vice President for Agriculture, announced the formation of a new department called Food Technology and Science (FT&S). This new unit combined all teaching, research, and extension operations in the Institute of Agriculture (UTIA) that were related to foods into a single department. The initial faculty members were drawn from the Departments of Dairy, Animal Husbandry Vet Science, and Food Technology. Dr. J.T. Miles, Head of the Dairy Department, was appointed to lead the new group. Faculty included Dr. Jimmy L. Collins and Dr. Melvin Johnston (Food Technology), Dr. Curtis C. Melton and Dr. William R. Backus (Meat Science), Dr. Bobby J. Demott, Dr. Woodrow W. Overcast, and Dr. Hugh O. Jaynes (Dairy),       and Dr. J. Orvin Mundt (Microbiology). Extension Specialists were Mr. Herbert C. Holt (Dairy Products), Dr. Frank D. Kirkpatrick (Meats), and Mr. Ivon E. McCarty (General Food Processing). Departmental facilities included McLeod Hall, part of McCord Hall, and the UT Creamery (now the Food Safety and Processing Building). For many years the U.T. Creamery was the source of milk and dairy products for UT. Mr. Herman Carringer was the manager until his retirement in December 1983. Mr. Tommy Burch took over as manager in March 1984. Due to financial constraints, the Creamery was closed in the fall of 1989. One of the first tasks when the department was formed in 1972 was to develop curricula for B.S. and M.S. programs. Undergraduate requirements were developed to meet those required to meet Institute of Food Technologists guidelines. Undergraduate programs are approved by the Higher Education Review Board of the Institute of Food Technologists (the professional society of food science and technology). The original B.S. curriculum satisfied the requirements and the program has remained on the approved list since, with the latest approval being received in 2009. Soon after its formation, the department began work for a Ph.D. program. A proposal for a Ph.D. program in FT&S was drafted in 1974, approved by the College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources and sent forward for approval by the Graduate School. The process was long, complicated, and required many revisions. With the arrival of Dr. C. W. Minkel as Dean of The Graduate School, the proposal moved quickly and was inaugurated fall quarter 1981. The curriculum was revised significantly in 1988 when the University of Tennessee moved to the semester system. The University of Tennessee Department of Food Science and Technology is the only food science department at any university in the state of Tennessee.","link":"http:\/\/foodscience.tennessee.edu\/history-of-the-department\/"},{"title":"Food Science Graduate Student Admissions Requirements","content":"Food Science Graduate Student Admissions Requirements Food Science GRE Requirements  Verbal + Quantitative score of 300 Minimum Verbal score of 145 Minimum Analytical Writing score of 3.5 UT Institutional code  1843 Food Science code  0107 Food Science TOEFL Requirements  Minimum acceptable scores  iBT (internet-based test) - 80 (with a minimum score of 20 in each sub-section) Computer-based test - 213 Paper-based test - 550 the IELTS may be used in place of the TOEFL - minimum score is 6.5","link":"http:\/\/foodscience.tennessee.edu\/food-study-graduate-student-admissions-requirements\/"},{"title":"Department of Food Science Timeline","content":"Department of Food Science Timeline  table id=6   ","link":"http:\/\/foodscience.tennessee.edu\/department-of-food-science-timeline\/"},{"title":"Historical Student Enrollment","content":"Historical Student Enrollment  table id=7   ","link":"http:\/\/foodscience.tennessee.edu\/historical-student-enrollment\/"},{"title":"Faculty Members (1972-Present)","content":"Faculty Members (1972-Present)  table id=8   ","link":"http:\/\/foodscience.tennessee.edu\/faculty-members-1972-present\/"},{"title":"Department Heads","content":"Department Heads 1959-Present  table id=9    *Deceased","link":"http:\/\/foodscience.tennessee.edu\/department-heads\/"},{"title":"Advisory Council","content":"Advisory Council Purpose The Food Science Advisory Council will assist the Department in keeping informed concerning the needs of its various stakeholders and constituencies and will advise the Department on ways and means of improving its effectiveness.

Since that time, she has transitioned into handling the department   s HR tasks and Travel Request. If you need assistance with things like hiring paperwork, payroll, building keys, or travel questions, she can be found in the Food Science administrative office (room 201). Now beware   she is quite the prankster and has been known to jump out and scare unsuspecting staff and faculty, but she says her favorite memory over the years has been dressing up as Santa for Christmas parties. While reflecting on her time with the department she says that she has enjoyed getting to know our international scholars and assisting students, faculty, and staff. Over the years the most notable changes about the department has the closing of the creamery and the new building. When Ann is not at work, she enjoys spending time with her family, playing games like Dominos, or shopping with friends. Mrs. Davean Brown began her career in Food Science in the summer of 1996. Davean started out as a secretary for faculty members within the department but has since taken the position of Business Manager. If students need assistance with fee waivers (graduate students), payroll questions, travel awards or if faculty or staff have questions about financials, she is the person to go to. Like Ann, her office is in the Food Science administrative office (room 201). Her favorite memories of the department have been all the laughter and fun times and most memorable was the painting party in McCloud. She says that changes in faculty and moving into a new building have brought about some challenges but have also led to lots of fun memories. When she isn   t at work, Davean likes to spend time with her husband and chasing her 6-yr. old son and scrapbooking & sewing.","link":"http:\/\/foodscience.tennessee.edu\/2019\/01\/28\/2019-spring-staff-spotlight\/"},{"title":"2018 Curriculum Advisory Board Meeting","content":"2018 Curriculum Advisory Board Meeting This fall we invited a variety of alumni and industry leaders to spend the day assessing our undergraduate program and help us determine our strengths and weaknesses. Those in attendance were gracious enough to take time away from their busy schedules and review the curriculum and extracurricular activities that our students will participate during their time in the Food Science department, and for this we are extremely grateful. Their dedication and passion for not only Food Science, but also the future of our students, is what will keep our program competitive. Our faculty put together information about their courses and gave a presentation to those at the meeting. We encouraged each member of the meeting to ask questions and give feedback about each course. We understand that those that have gone through the program and have been in the food science industry are one of our greatest resources and our relationship with them allows us to properly prepare our students for different types of careers within the Food Science industry.","link":"http:\/\/foodscience.tennessee.edu\/2019\/01\/28\/2018-curriculum-advisory-board-meeting\/"},{"title":"Fall 2018 Recruiting","content":"Fall 2018 Recruiting When high school students are looking at majors, often times they are uncertain as to what Food Science is and what kinds of careers, they could have with a Food Science Major. By attending college fairs, classrooms, and inviting high school students into the department for a hands-on activity we can convey to them the importance of Food Science and safety in our daily lives. During the fall semester we spent time traveling throughout Tennessee meeting students and teachers. Mrs. Karen Jones attended the Tennessee Science Teachers Association Conference held in Murfreesboro, TN. and the opportunity to hold a Q & A session for the teachers attending the conference. We also visited places like Martin, Cookeville, Nashville, and Jefferson City. Many of these events welcomed students from surrounding cities and counties which we hope will lead to us welcoming even more student from all around Tennessee! We plan to continue attending college and career fairs in the future. Not only will this allow us to garner exposure to a multitude of students, it will also help to keep us engaged with teachers throughout Tennessee.","link":"http:\/\/foodscience.tennessee.edu\/2019\/01\/28\/fall-2018-recruiting\/"},{"title":"Spring 2019 Alumni Spotlight","content":"Spring 2019 Alumni Spotlight What degree did you receive from UT and what year s did you receive your degree s? Why did you choose UT   s Food Science program? I came to UT from UT Chattanooga as a junior in 1982.   I received my B.S. in 1984 and my M.S. in 1986.   I chose UT Food Technology and Science (the department name at the time) because I enjoyed science courses and liked that Food Science had a narrower focus than just Chemistry or Biology.   As a child, I used to read my cereal boxes while I ate breakfast, so I guess it was inevitable that I would end up in Food Science! What is your current position or what was your last position? I am currently in the only position from which I have derived income since graduating in 1986.   I stayed home with our 3 children for over 25 years before becoming a Lecturer at UTK in Food Science in 2012.   I also serve as the department   s Undergraduate Program Coordinator and as an Academic Advisor for many of our students.  I enjoy helping coach the College Bowl team too. How did your experiences at UT help to shape your career path?   My favorite thing about UT Food Science was the people   the other students, staff, and faculty members. The faculty and staff genuinely cared about the students and wanted to help them succeed in their educational and career goals.   I suppose that is why I now choose to teach and advise our current students, and I hope to provide them the same care and attention that was shown to me. Future goals? Even though my husband is already retired from UT, I plan to continue teaching for a few more years as long as I am having fun and the students are learning.   At some point, I will retire and enjoy spending time with my current and future grandchildren and the rest of my family. Favorite memories of your time at UT? I enjoyed hanging out with other students   and faculty in the department as we would get together at someone   s apartment for food and fun. Everyone in the department knew each other since it was a small department.   I was elected as Chairman of the IFT Student Association and I enjoyed going to the IFT conferences in New Orleans, Anaheim (we also went to Disneyland!), and Atlanta with the other students and faculty, and initiating the first college bowl competition in Atlanta in 1985. What advice would you give to current and future students? 1.) Take your education seriously, i.e.    Go to class! Work hard.    2..) Learn to look for and grab the opportunities that are around you. 3.) Find some joy in every situation.   Life is too short to be miserable! 4.) People are more important than things. 5.) Count your blessings","link":"http:\/\/foodscience.tennessee.edu\/2019\/01\/28\/spring-2019-alumni-spotlight\/"},{"title":"2019 Spring Envoy Update","content":"2019 Spring Envoy Update Food Science Envoys are students who represent the department   s mission and values.

He was featured in UTRF   s Inventor Spotlight where he discusses his work with synthetic biology and the development of biosensors. We were curious to learn more about biosensors and how they play into food science. Lenaghan explains that with the advancement of biosensors in crops, that farmers would be able to detect problems such as drought and pests in localized regions of a farmer s field. The biosensors could be detected from close-up with handheld detectors, or from space using remote satellite imaging. This would allow the farmer to treat that specific area, not the whole crop, which would save on time and resources. Research such as this focuses on global food security, which with an exponential growth in population over the next several years, is of world-wide concern among many. Dr. Lenaghan   s research expands on the traditional scope of food science and helps to further the department   s research by opening the door to new collaborations across disciplines. Dr. Lenaghan is a co-director and founder of the  Center for Agricultural Synthetic Biology (CASB) along with Dr. Neal Stewart, from Plant Sciences.
