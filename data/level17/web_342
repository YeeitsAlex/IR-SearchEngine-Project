Hodges    I was born in Roebling, New Jersey, a small town about ten miles south of the state capital, Trenton. I earned a bachelor   s degree in French (minor German and high school teaching certification) from Arcadia University and went on to the University of Chicago, where I received a master   s degree and a doctorate in Germanic languages and literatures with a focus on 19th and 20th century German literature. While in graduate school I met and married John O. Hodges, who earned a master   s degree and a doctorate in religion and literature from the University of Chicago Divinity School. He retired from teaching in the UT Department of Religious Studies in December 2010. We have one son, Daniel, who is a software engineer. He lives in Dallas with his wife Manisha, who is a data analyst and merchandise planner. During my free time I enjoy reading, cooking, travel (especially international travel), learning languages (I have studied Spanish, French, German, Swedish, Italian, and a bit of Mandarin Chinese), and solving word games. PEER  What brought you to UT? Hodges    My husband and I came to UT in 1982 when he was recruited by the Department of Religious Studies. At the same time, I applied for and was hired as a faculty member in what was then the Department of Germanic and Slavic Languages, which later merged with Romance Languages to become Modern Foreign Languages and Literatures.   I taught undergraduate and graduate German language and literature courses and comparative literature. The opportunity for the two of us to join the campus was part of a vigorous attempt by the university to increase faculty and student diversity under the auspices of the Geier federal lawsuit, which mandated that the State of Tennessee build and maintain a single, rather than dual, system of public higher education that offered equal access to all and would eliminate any remaining evidence of segregation. This was a great opportunity for both of us, since we wanted positions that would allow us to focus on teaching and research at a  major college or university. PEER    What are your research interests? Hodges    My scholarly work. My teaching and research displays a broad interest in interdisciplinary studies and a global approach to literary studies have emphasized three major areas  multicultural perspectives in modern German literature, comparative literature, and multicultural education. My published books and articles focus on comparisons of African-American, Afro-German, and German voices in literature and on theoretical and pedagogical approaches to multicultural education. I have collaborated with university graduate programs to establish partnerships with universities in France, Italy, and China, and was a two-week guest administrator in 2011 at Wuhan University in China.    PEER    How was it as an incoming tenure track faculty?   What was the diversity like on campus? Hodges    At the time when I arrived, diversity on campus was undergoing change and experiencing substantial growth as a result of the Geier litigation.   Over the course of a few years the numbers of faculty, staff, and students of color increased substantially. PEER    What sparked your interest in becoming dean of the graduate school?   How was the change from faculty to dean? Hodges    In 2005 when I attended the Bryn Mawr Institute for Women in Higher Education Administration, one assignment we had was to think about related to what our professional trajectory might be in the coming years. I began considering the possibility of seeking a college dean position , but in 2006, when Bob Holub, then provost, decided to reinstate the Graduate School, I decided it was a position that suited my interests and to which I could readily apply the administrative skills I had gained.   I liked the idea of being able to work with faculty (graduate directors, the Graduate Council, graduate associate deans) and a broad variety of constituents across campus to have an impact on the academic and professional preparation of master   s and doctoral degree students. My instincts were correct, because it was the most rewarding of the several administrative leadership positions I have held. PEER  What were some key accomplishments and ideas you were able to implement as dean of the UT Graduate School?   What accomplishment as dean are you most proud of? Hodges  Key accomplishments (*most proud of) Rebuilding and restructuring of the Graduate School and enhancing the profile of graduate education at UT. In 2001, the Graduate School had been dismantled and operations were managed from a small Office of Graduate Studies, while admissions functions were located in Enrollment Services in combination with Undergraduate Admissions. The 2006 mandate for re-instatement of the Graduate School was enacted by Provost Holub with a vision toward enhancing the profile and effectiveness of graduate education that was in keeping with UT   s identification as a high research institution. Establishment of the Office of Graduate Training and Mentorship In 2008 UT applied for and obtained a prestigious training grant, the Program for Equity and Excellence in Research (PEER) which helped direct our focus on fostering inclusive excellence in graduate education, on strengthening departmental recruitment efforts, and on stressing strategies in mentoring and professional development to bolster retention.     Many PEER program elements (e. g., speakers, and workshops) have been extended to all graduate students. Working directly with graduate students. I   ve particularly enjoyed working with groups of graduate students (e.g., Graduate Student Senate, NSF Fellows) as well as individual undergraduate students preparing for graduate school (e.g., Educational Advancement Program, Tennessee Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation, recruitment efforts outside of UT). PEER    What have you found most rewarding while working with PEER? Hodges    I have found my work with PEER to be rewarding in many ways, particularly the opportunities for helping to mentor highly talented underrepresented students in STEM who receive doctorates and go on to make outstanding contributions. I   ve also enjoyed learning about developments in STEM education and research that will have a profound effect on the future of our state, nation, and world. I have also enjoyed very much the opportunity to collaborate with dedicated, outstanding faculty and staff at UT and beyond who are deeply committed to broadening participation in graduate education. PEER   Any regrets?   Any one thing you wish you could have done before stepping down from your  former position as dean?   Hodges    I don   t have any regrets about having served a vice provost and dean of the Graduate  School.   As I indicated above, it was the most rewarding of the several administrative leadership positions I have held because it was an opportunity to use the combined skills I had attained in earlier positions and it provided exciting new insights on benchmarks of achievement to which our campus could aspire. I would like to have been directly involved with completion implementation of three things  final overhaul of the website  launching of a graduate-level electronic degree audit system  and development of a framework for institutionalizing of the grant-supported PEER program after external funding is no longer available. PEER    Do you feel that the campus climate has improved, experienced setbacks, or remained the same since you first came to UT?   Hodges    This is a complicated question. In terms of climate, I think that current undergraduate and graduate student activism has energized the campus and therefore contributed positively to the climate at a time when it is very much needed because of external pressures that question commitment and challenge efforts to build and sustain inclusive excellence. The Faculty Senate and faculty in general have supported the efforts of the students, and I am heartened by that. The crucial question is how their efforts will be sustained and reap benefits that will support a climate of inclusive excellence, and attract resources to recruit and retain a diverse population of outstanding students, faculty, and staff who reflect the goal of inclusive excellence and the rapidly shifting demographics of our country. PEER    What can we expect to see from you in this new chapter of your career and life? Hodges    I will engage in continued involvement with students     undergraduate and graduate     to provide intense mentoring and professional development on a more individual level.   I am committed to ongoing involvement with PEER as long as the grant is supported with federal funding  my ultimate wish would be to see the program institutionalized after funding has come to an end. I see PEER as one of the premier training grants in this country with a framework that could benefit many graduate programs on our campus.   Given resources to make it permanent, the program could serve as a model for other institutions. I will spend more time on my research projects and teaching  I am already engaged with a project with colleagues across the country who are interested in German Diaspora Studies. Serving as a board member for the Georgiana Simpson Society, I am working with them on a symposium and publication to highlight themes in research and teaching related to German Diaspora Studies, in particular, to Germany   s connections to Africans and African Americans as reflected in literature, history and culture and as a resource for teaching German language and culture. I look forward to continuing to serve my colleagues on campus and nationally as a resource to assist with broadening participation in graduate education.

Eduardo Ponce is a 3rd year PEER scholar in the Computer Science program at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. Eduardo obtained his bachelor   s & master   s degrees in Computer and Electrical Engineering from the Polytechnic University of Puerto Rico and participated in a long stint of internships at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. While there, Eduardo was encouraged to pursue his PhD by his current advisor, Dr. Greg Peterson. Dr. Peterson recommended the PEER program in conjunction with the Interdisciplinary Graduate Minor in Computational Science at UT. Upon being accepted into UT, Eduardo chose the goal of    doing science that helps the world   . However, he had no idea what his research could be until he was awarded a PEER fellowship that allowed him to meet other scholars in the life sciences who noted the difficulty of handling large amounts of data. As he notes    I felt a lot of pressure figuring out what sort of research I wanted to pursue and it wasn   t until I met other students and researchers from a variety of disciplines that I found an interesting problem I could tackle.    His research addresses the issue of managing big data in bioinformatics by porting and enhancing codes for emerging computing technologies. Currently, he explores how to optimize software to efficiently manage and analyze data obtained from biology laboratories resulting in faster report findings. In doing this, Eduardo hopes the software he and his colleagues develop can further bridge the worlds of computer science and biomedical research. Additionally, Eduardo notes about PEER,    The graduate salary   from PEER is competitive and the PEER discourse meetings have helped me improve personal, academic, and professional skills. For example, it has really taught me time management, communication techniques, presentational tips, and a variety of interpersonal skills via the discourse meetings and guest lectures. Also, the mentors and staff in PEER really care. They certainly care about me as a scholar, but they also care about me as a person.

As a PEER mentor, Dr. Diambra contributes in a variety of ways. He explains,    My educational background is in Counseling & Psychology, so I share my expertise with PEER students on issues surrounding wellness related activities and sustaining a work-life balance as it specifically relates to them being doctoral students. I like to focus on how managing their wellness now will evolve and can apply to their future careers. I believe that the soft sciences have something to contribute and our soft science programs can reap the benefits of a program like this (PEER), even if I am not in the STEM disciplines.    Dr. Diambra is the kind of mentor that looks for lessons in every opportunity. In his own life, he builds off of classroom activities from past mentors that helped him and applies them into his own classes. Dr. Diambra has even applied lessons that he learned from his participation in the PEER program.    I   ve integrated some of the attitude and activities from PEER into our own doctoral program as the former PhD Program Coordinator. I have learned much from the mentorship aspect of PEER, by being exposed to other mentors and through the PEER students. I believe other faculty and administration from different disciplines can benefit from working with PEER like I have.     On mentorship, Dr. Diambra explains,    PEER Students get a chance to break out of their shell and build relationships with faculty mentors in a safe space. The mentors in PEER have traversed similar ground (as former students) and are passionate about nurturing students    professional and personal experiences while at and beyond UT.

Keep learning!    According to the National Academy of Sciences, in order to maintain the U.S. science and engineering workforce we must invest in the talents of all Americans, especially minorities. The Program for Excellence & Equity in Research (PEER) is supporting this effort by collaborating with STEM departments at The University of Tennessee, Knoxville (UT), to recruit, retain, and facilitate graduating underrepresented Ph.D. students in behavioral or biomedical research fields. PEER, is a graduate training program funded by a grant from the NIH designed to enhance the graduate experience of first and second year students from any eligible graduate program at UT and to increase their competitiveness after graduation. PEER provides professional and skills development that go beyond traditional classroom academics and research skills. PEER   s holistic approach to graduate training ensures that scholars develop skills and attributes that will be needed for successful careers, well beyond the Ph.D. degree.    PEER   s professional development workshops helped me by improving my writing and presentation skills, as well as developing skills in fellowship and grant writing.   These are skills that I presently use to write grants to support my research,    said Dr. Pelagie Favi. (   14), a recent Ph.D. graduate from UT who started as a PEER scholar. Favi is currently a Future Faculty Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Chemical Engineering at Northeastern University under the mentorship of Dr. Thomas J. Webster. Her primary research focuses on developing and characterizing advanced biomaterials to restore normal function to injured or diseased tissues. Prior to joining UT and PEER, Favi completed her undergraduate studies in chemical engineering from Montana State University and master   s degree in biomedical engineering from Virginia Commonwealth University. Favi   s desire to be an independent researcher and to help solve problems, such as heart disease and shattered bones, led her to pursue a doctoral degree in Material Science & Engineering at UT.    I am a better engineer today.    Favi credits her success as a scientist not only to the challenging classes at UT, but also to the mentoring, professional skills development and financial support provided by PEER. She specifically mentions how PEER   s requirement for her drafting an individual development plan, facilitated her success as a graduate student.   Having the mentoring support of faculty from multiple disciplines across campus is unique to PEER.   The faculty mentoring team supports scholars in their scientific development by providing expert advice and identifying resources to overcome any potential barrier to degree completion, but also as role models to the diverse PEER scholars by, sharing their experiences and personal academic stories. Similarly, PEER scholars are trained to mentor entering graduate students, constantly expanding the mentoring network available to these students.
