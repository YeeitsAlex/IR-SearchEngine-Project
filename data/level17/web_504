               It has taken me a while to write this.  I first met Sean the first week he started as an officer at MIT. I was still working for IS&amp;T at the time and was traveling on my electric scooter to a client appointment in BCS when I rode by Sean and Captain John DiFava at STATA. What I remembered most from the encounter was how curious he was about the scooter I was using to get to my appointments across campus. I remember a very congenial, curious, and friendly person who was eager to know the people in the community he was serving.  I remember him telling me that seeing new technology like the one I was using was one of the reasons he was with the MIT police. Most police officers I have had the privilege of meeting have either instinctively, or as a matter of training, tended to be on the side of separation from the civilian community. Many seem to be more comfortable choosing to interact as little as possible with members of the community they are sworn to protect. Not Sean. I had one great encounter with a young officer who made a lasting impression on this IT professional.  I still fondly remember thinking to myself if more police officers were like Sean, our world would be a much more awesome place.  He was a member of our community.  He was one of us. And we miss him.

               We lost a wonderful person 6 months ago. I salute Officer Collier and the people who played a role in his life to foster such a wonderful soul.

               My husband and I met him in Hull a couple of years ago when he was a summer cop there.  Why a nice young man.  We spoke about being police officers in NJ, and how he was working hard to get picked up someplace full time.  Such a senseless crime.  But he died doing the job he loved.  Had he lived, he would have excelled in his job.

               Hey MIT PD. We see you every day and are rooting for you. I volunteered for and ran in Run to Remember to help heal but it's just so sad and heartbreaking today, worse than the day we found out. To Sean, his family, and PD brothers and sisters I don't know how to expressed my condolences. But I am so proud to live in Somerville now that Sean has a Somerville PD badge.
               <br/>
               Hang in there guys. We're all in it together in Kendall square, one day at a time, rooting for MIT PD.

               2 years ago I met Sean.  He adopted my cat from me through a Craigslist ad.   My wife and I were overwhelmed with a dog and a new baby so had to put the cat 'ninja' up for adoption.  Sean responded to the ad and him and I emailed each other a few times back and forth about caring for the animal.  Sean was taking care of a family cat that was 19 when it passed and so he wanted to care for another cat.  I live 40 minutes west of city and Sean came to my house and we had a short conversation.  He told me that he was in training at police academy and was going to be a Sommerville police officer some day.  He was very excited to see and take care of Ninja, he left my house about 15 minutes later.  I found Sean's email the other day and had forgotten the day he came to my house.  I will not forget you Sean and neither will Ninja.  RIP

               Rest in Peace Officer Sean Collier.  You are now joined with your 19,000 brothers in Blue who's names are permanently carved on the Memorial Walls in Judiciary Square in Washington D.C.  On August 5, 2013 you will be remembered and recognized by the Officer Harold L. Vitale Memorial Fund, Inc. at a gathering at our Memorial golf tournament held in Officer Vitale's honor (EOW 6/18/85, Saugus PD, Badge #17) some 27 years after his death.  He is not forgotten and you will not be forgotten.  We thank you for your service and sacrifice.  You actions and your professionalism remind us all about the dangers of the job, and you also remind us why freedom is not free.   Our condolences to your family.  You are a true American Hero.  Thank you.  Well done Officer Collier, well done.  The members of the Officer Vitale Memorial Fund.
              </p>
