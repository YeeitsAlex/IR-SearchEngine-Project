The first known peer-reviewed published account acknowledging the presence of animals in the social environment of clients was a case summary in Social Work (Bikales, 1975). Gerda Bikales, wrote about a medical social worker and a canine case management client. The social worker recounted the case of an elderly woman and her only companion, Lacey the mutt, with social work colleagues and her    sad ruminations brought forth a chorus of instant recognition and the somewhat stunned realization that they had discovered a sleeper in casework practice, (pg. 150). However, social work literature has addressed issues of pet loss (Margolies, 2003) animal-assisted therapy (Reichert, 1998), companion animals and well-being (Sable, 1995), the importance of pets for the elderly (Netting & Wilson, 1987), the link between interpersonal violence and animal abuse (Strand & Faver, 2005), social work implications of animal hoarding (Arluke, Frost, Steketee, Patronek, Luke, Messner, Nathanson, & Papazian, 2002), and even social work in veterinary clinic settings (Netting, Wilson & New, 1987). The social work literature has even engaged in debate about social workers  responsibility under the NASW Code of Ethics to attend to the welfare of animals themselves (e.g. Wolf, 2000, O Brien, 2003). What has been missing is the solidifying and professionalizing of this aspect of social work practice.","link":"https:\/\/vetsocialwork.utk.edu\/about-us\/"},{"title":"Vision &#038; Mission","content":"Vision & Mission Vision UT VSW seeks to expand understanding about the services needed at the intersection of veterinary medicine and social work practice.

Students will be given a passcode on the first day of class. Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) was founded by John Kabat-Zinn at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center in 1979. The program was designed to help human patients who were not responding to other forms of medical treatment. MBSR has now spread to multiple populations including health professionals and medical and nursing students as well as in multiple settings including work places, educational settings and even prisons. UT VSW is the first to offer this class at a veterinary teaching institution. Two decades of published research indicates that the majority of people who complete MBSR courses report  Lasting decreases in physical and psychological symptoms An increased ability to relax Reductions in pain levels and an enhanced ability to cope with pain that may not go away Greater energy and enthusiasm for life Improved self-esteem An ability to cope more effectively with both short and long-term stressful situations.  box title=   border_width= 1  border_style= solid  bg_color= #B9E1E2  align= center   Click here to register for the next MBSR Course.   box  In the News Mindfulness is  Mindfulness is a purposeful, non-anxious, reflective presence that can be applied to any aspect of  medical  practice -Ronald M.

Veterinarians are said to experience death at a higher rate than human doctors do simply because the life span of animals is generally shorter. In some animal shelters hundreds of animals are often euthanized each day due to over population. Animal control workers and humane officers, like adult and child protective service workers, must witness neglected and abused animals on a daily basis. All of this can create high levels of compassion fatigue among animal related professionals. Veterinary social workers offer help with the precursors and after effects of compassion fatigue. Teaching skills in grief accommodation and providing supportive group or individual consultation is important for animal-related workers. Many veterinarians, for instance, feel guilty or at fault when they lose patients. Animal shelter euthanasia technicians also struggle with feelings of guilt and grief because of the responsibilities of their jobs. Stressful and traumatic experiences are high in veterinary medical and animal shelter environments. Moreover, the over population of endless unwanted animals becomes very stressful for animal shelter and rescue group workers. Therefore teaching stress management skills is extremely important for veterinary social workers to offer in caring for people who care for animals. People who love and want to work with animals as their professional role often feel more affinity to animals than they do to people. This, in addition to chronic compassion fatigue, can contribute to high conflict and low conflict management skills in these settings. Therefore, the role of the veterinary social worker as mediator is extremely important in caring for people who care for animals. Discussions regarding the proper care of animals can quickly become contentious as people begin to judge others in not knowing the right way to treat animals. Since social work is a HUMAN profession, veterinary social workers must put aside their own opinions about the proper use of animals, and instead be a neutral non-anxious presence, helping arguing parties come to consensus for common ground and work. This is probably one of the most important and society changing roles of veterinary social work. If you are an animal related professional experiencing compassion fatigue, stress, grief, trauma, and or conflict, please feel free to call the Veterinary Social Work Helpline at 865-755-8839  for a consultation.

Since then more and more research has been conducted about the link between human and animal violence. This type of violence often occurs in family violence situations, where animals become victims of perpetrators like their human beings do. More and more states now have felony level animal cruelty statutes to acknowledge the true danger often associated with this form of violence. Many states are also adopting cross reporting laws where human and animal welfare professionals must report suspected violence across species.

Ascione, F.R., Weber, C.V., & Wood, D.S. (1997). The abuse of animals and domestic violence  A national survey of shelters for women who are battered. Society and Animals, 5(3), 205-218. Based on a survey of one domestic violence shelter in each of 49 states, this study found that 84% of the shelters reported that women discuss incidences of animal abuse when they enter the shelter. Yet, relatively few domestic violence shelters include questions about pets on intake assessments or provide formalized means of arranging for the care of pets in treatment planning. Flynn, C.P. (2000). Woman s best friend  Pet abuse and the role of companion animals in the lives of battered women. Violence Against Women, 6(2), 162-177. This study examined the extent of pet abuse in the households of women entering a battered women s shelter in South Carolina, and gave particular attention to what happened to the pets when the women entered the shelter. The study also asked whether women delayed seeking shelter because of their pets, and if so, how long. Flynn, C.P. (2000). Battered women and their animal companions  Symbolic interaction between human and nonhuman animals. Society and Animals, 8(2), 99-127. Using a subsample of the women in the previous study, Flynn examined the particular ways battered women interacted with their pets while in the abusive household and also explored how the women felt about their companion animals after separating from them to enter the shelter.

All four areas of VSW are encompassed in the term    Human Animal Interactions.    There are various forms of HAI that have beneficial outcomes for human beings.   These various forms have definitions that demarcate one from another. Also, in the literature, there is some crossover between terms. In 2014, the International Association of Human-Animal Interaction Organizations (IAHAIO) released a white paper highlighting these distinctions. We have aligned our definitions with IAHAIO   s   in order to support consistency (which is lacking in the field of HAI).   Additionally, we clarify that there is a difference between therapy animals, emotional support animals,   companion animals and service animals.   It is important to make these distinctions in order to grasp a deeper understanding of human animal interactions. Types of interventions Animal Assisted Intervention (AAI) is an intervention that intentionally includes an animal as part of the therapeutic process. These interventions are goal oriented and structured. AAI can be utilized in health, education, and human services (IAHAIO, 2014). The individuals conducting AAI must have knowledge of the people and animals incorporated in the therapeutic process.   Animal Assisted Therapy and Animal Assisted Education are formal services that incorporate AAI. Animal-Assisted Therapy (AAT) is a structured therapeutic intervention with deliberate inclusion of an animal in a therapeutic treatment plan. Generally, AAT involves a licensed therapist who guides interactions between a patient and an animal to reach specific goals (Chandler, 2012  IAHAIO, 2014). Similar to traditional therapy, AAT must utilize a plan, monitor client progress, and be documented in therapy notes (IAHAIO, 2014).   The inclusion of an animal is designed to accomplish outcomes believed to be difficult to achieve without the animal (Nimer & Lundahl, 2007). Animal Assisted Education (AAE) must be conducted by a qualified teacher and in an educational setting. AAE is formal, goal oriented, and structured. This form of intervention has various desired outcomes including improved cognitive functioning, academic goals, social skills, and responsible pet ownership (IAHAIO, 2014). Animal-Assisted Activities (AAA) are informal interactions that can be led by professionals, paraprofessionals and volunteers. In order for human-animal teams to take part in AAA they must have received some form of assessment or introductory training. These activities have a wide variety of purposes including motivational, educational, and recreational (Kruger and Serpell, 2006  IAHAIO, 2014).   Though these are informal interactions, they must be planned and goal oriented (IAHAIO, 2014).   AAA is commonly seen in nursing homes and hospitals (Chandler, 2012). Animal Species Within AAI literature there is the use of a wide variety of animals. In order to be used in interventions or activities, animals must be domesticated and well socialized. Animals commonly used include dogs, cats, rabbits, gerbils, guinea pigs, birds and rats. Other animals that may be effective in animal assisted interventions include miniature horses, cows, goats and chickens. Horses have two terms used to describe their use in animal assisted interventions. The first term is Equine-Facilitated Psychotherapy (EFP). This is when a horse is used to assist in mental health therapy. The second term is Hippotherapy, which is when a therapist uses the movement of the horse to increase physical mobility of the client (Kruger and Serpell, 2006). Not all animals are suitable for animals assisted interventions or activities. Animals which are not suitable include species that are not domesticated, such as dolphins and monkeys, and animals that are not well socialized. These animals are unpredictable and can cause harm to those around them. Active Animal Roles Therapy animals are animals that are used by licensed therapists that aid in the achievement of therapeutic goals. In order for an animal to qualify they must meet certain criteria (Kruger and Serpell, 2010). Animals must be obedience trained and thoroughly evaluated in order to maximize positive interactions between client and animal (National Service Animal Registry, 2016). Animal assisted activity animals are animals that are brought in by a volunteer, paraprofessional, or professional. These animals are typically pets that have had some form of training or assessment. Animals used in animal assisted activities can help with a variety of tasks depending on the purpose of their visit. An example of an animal assisted activity program is the HABIT Ruff Reading program. The HABIT Ruff Reading program puts dogs and volunteers, which have gone through a screening process, into classrooms. The dog provides a source a comfort for young students as they read aloud. Emotional support animals provide therapeutic support to individuals who are suffering from debilitating symptoms (Wisch, 2015). In order for an animal to be considered an emotional support animal, a licensed therapist must be able to verify that their clients level of functioning is directly dependent on an animal. Emotional support animals have limited legal protection. The Fair Housing Act and the Department of Housing and Urban Development require housing providers to make accommodations for those with emotional support animals. Even if housing providers do not allow pets, it is illegal to discriminate against tenants who have emotional support animals. Additionally, it is unlawful to impose a pet deposit or fee for an emotional support animal (U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, 2013). Another law that prohibits discrimination against emotional support animals is the Air Carrier Access Act (U.S. Department of Transportation, 2003). This act requires airlines to allow emotional support animals on flights along with their owners. For more information about these acts, please reference the links below. *** UT Veterinary Social Work position statement  In order for a person to ethically obtain a therapist s letter for an emotional support animal, they must have an ongoing relationship with a therapist within their state of residence for six months or more. After six months, the therapist must be able to confirm that the client requires an emotional support animal to alleviate symptoms of their diagnosis. Additionally,   there are various websites that unethically sell emotional support animal certificates without assessing a client. The Veterinary Social Work Certificate Program does not support social workers providing documentation after less than 6 months of ongoing contact or the use of these websites. *** Service animals are trained to be medical assistants to the disabled and are permitted to accompany their owner, handler, or trainer in public facilities and accommodations (i.e. guide dog) (Chandler, 2012). Service animals can offer assistance in a variety of ways including, but not limited to, guiding those with visual impairments, alerting the hard of hearing to sounds, warning handlers of an oncoming seizure and reminding their handler to take their medication (Brennan & Nguyen, 2014).   Service animals are protected under the Americans with Disabilities Act. In addition to prohibiting access to public facilities, this act prohibits discrimination in housing, employment, education, transportation and air travel. Unlike service animals, therapy animals are not medical assistants and therefore are prevented from accompanying owners into every facility. Another important distinction between service animals and therapy animal is that service animals are not supposed to be touched without permission and notice of both the animal and the handler. For more information about service animal rights, please reference the link below. https   portal.hud.gov hudportal documents huddoc?id=servanimals_ntcfheo2013-01.pdf http   airconsumer.dot.gov rules 382short.pdf https   adata.org publication service-animals-booklet Passive Animal Roles Companion animals permanently live with a human and can help to increase the animal and human quality of life (Hart, 2006). These animals are also known as pets. Wildlife   provides an opportunity for humans to observe animals, rather than physically interact with them. In 2009, approximately 60 million people in Americans considered themselves bird watchers (Chambers, 2014). Farm animals can take an active role in animal assisted activities, however more often they play a passive role. Farm animals, similar to wildlife, provide an opportunity for individuals to observe animals. Some individuals raise farm animals for a food, while others consider them to be pets. Special Considerations Though animals may be beneficial to the therapeutic process, it is important to be conscious of the animals needs. When working with animals we must be aware of our tendency to project our own thoughts and feelings onto the animals involved. For more information on animal well being please refer to the IAHAIO White Paper. Please also partner with animal related professionals to ensure animal well-being is maintained.

We begin with an overview of research in this field, including a review of the limited outcome data on animal abuse interventions. Etiological models of animal abuse based in attachment theory, personality theory, systems theory, cognitive theory, behavior theory, and psychodynamic theory are presented along with proposed typologies of animal abuse. We review the DSM-V s inclusion of animal abuse in conduct disorder, as well as considering additional diagnoses and clinical presentations where harm to animals may be relevant. Emphasizing the heterogeneity of animal abuse presentations and the importance of individualized assessment, factors to consider in assessment are reviewed with reference to case examples. Participants learn to use the Boat Inventory on Animal-Related Experiences, a semi-structured clinical interview, to guide assessment  they also become familiar with other instruments that measure animal abuse, and develop their knowledge of general assessment instruments that include items pertaining to animal abuse. Group review of taped interviews serves as a basis for discussion of strategy, including techniques for building rapport with both children and adults resistant to disclosing socially undesirable behavior or describing traumatic experiences of witnessing animal abuse. Participants  own potential discomfort in working with individuals who have harmed animals is also explored in depth, including aversion to asking and hearing about animal abuse in the assessment context. Participants are encouraged to consider implications for treatment planning that may derive from incorporating information about animal abuse. How does the phenotype and apparent function of the abusive behavior guide treatment decision? The AniCare model of treatment, based on empirically-supported techniques for behavior change, is introduced with case videos, vignette analysis, and role-play opportunities. Finally, participants review laws relevant to professionals working with animal abuse, including states that mandate or permit court-ordered evaluation and or treatment of animal abusers, and discuss how human services and animal protection systems can better work together to address animal abuse. At the conclusion of this workshop, participants will be able to  Describe the impact of animal abuse on individuals and family systems, citing available research on animal abuse and its link to other behavior problems. Explain key factors to consider in assessing animal abuse, and conduct an assessment interview to explore a client s relationships with animals. Use assessment data to guide choice of intervention strategies. Bestiality  The Best Kept Secret in America Jenny Edwards  BIO  Zoosexuality (also referred to as  bestiality  and  zoophilia ) is the sexual orientation of a human to an animal. For most individuals, the concept of humans having sex with animals is abhorrent or taboo. As a result, the topic is seldom researched, studied, or openly discussed.   Abundant historical and anthropological evidence, however, suggests that such relationships have existed for millennia, and some studies estimate that zoosexuals comprise 3-8% of the general population. Bestiality is illegal throughout most of the United States and is considered a paraphilia, or sexual perversity, by the American Psychiatric Association. Each year an unknown number of animals and humans are traumatized, injured, or killed after aggressive or repeated sexual acts. Animals are frequently solicited, traded or sold specifically for sex. They are filmed having intercourse with their own species as well as with human partners.     Far too often, they are found in pornography videos where children or adult couples are involved. While there are known links between animal cruelty and human violence, few studies have examined the link between bestiality and other forms of criminal behavior, including trespass, substance abuse, or sexual assault and exploitation of children and adults.

Summit Highlights Debbie Stoewen - Compassion Fatigue  What it Is, What it Isn   t, and What Can Be Done Dr. Debbie Stoewen is a licensed veterinarian and registered social worker with a PhD specializing in veterinary medical communication. She is the Director of Veterinary Affairs for LifeLearn and the Director of Veterinary Services (as well as Care & Empathy Officer) for Pets Plus Us. The 5th IVSWS started with a workshop facilitated by Dr. Stoewen titled Compassion Fatigue  What it Is, What it Isn   t, and What Can Be Done.   Her workshop discussed how compassion fatigue affects physical and mental health, professional competence and success, and vocational direction and development, as well as the consequences of compassion fatigue. Additionally, the workshop discussed strategies to mitigate the effects of compassion fatigue. Animals and Poverty Simulation In addition to keynotes speakers and presentations, this years summit featured a simulation experience created and led by Dr. Frieda Herron from the UT College of Social Work. The purpose of this simulation was to increase awareness of some of the barriers that pet owners living in poverty experience. Attendees were divided into groups, and given information about their    families    which included a picture of their family pet. The families were then given information and went through 3 scenarios  grocery shopping, locating housing, and securing pet resources. This was an eye opening experience for many. After the role play, there was a debrief in which participants talked about what it was like, and brainstormed what could be done to help animal owners who are living in poverty. The photos below provide a glimpse into the simulation in action.  gallery size= medium  link= none  columns= 2  ids= 2136,2137    gallery columns= 2  size= medium  ids= 2150,2135   A place for play! Not only did the summit provide an amazing opportunity to learn and exchange ideas, but it also was an opportunity for attendees to play. When we allow ourselves to be spontaneous or creative, playfully enjoying novel experiences, we help make new connections in the brain. Play is one of the The Wellness Owls which are based on the Healthy Mind Platter, developed by Dr. Dan Siegel and David Rock. According to the Healthy Mind Platter website, The Healthy Mind Platter    has seven essential mental activities necessary for optimum mental health in daily life. These seven daily activities make up the full set of    mental nutrients    that your brain needs to function at its best. By engaging every day in each of these servings, you enable your brain to coordinate and balance its activities, which strengthens your brain   s internal connections and your connections with other people.    More information on the Healthy Mind Platter and other works by Dr. Dan Siegel, a neuropsychiatrist, can be found by clicking here. Thank you to our sponsors!
