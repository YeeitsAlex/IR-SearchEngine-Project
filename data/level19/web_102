         According to the Michigan State University Extension publication “How to Create a Productive Mindset,”…The mind has 70,000 thoughts per day…that’s 70,000 opportunities. The brain is about two percent of your body weight – but uses 20 percent of your energy. Eighty percent of repetitive thoughts are negative, but don’t have to be.
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition to the Michigan State University Extension publication mentioned earlier, Iowa State University Extension Dairy Specialists Dr. Fred Hall and Dr. Larry Tranel provide the following suggestions for coping with stress:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Self-Talk – remind yourself that you have been through difficult times before and will do so again.
         </li>
         <li>
          Choose words like “calm”, “capable”, and “controlled” to maintain a positive mindset.
         </li>
         <li>
          Use deep breathing – do this five times and release slowly.
         </li>
         <li>
          Accept the situation and focus on solutions instead of focusing on the problem.
         </li>
         <li>
          Avoid negative people.
         </li>
         <li>
          Check in on your friends and family. Men generally don’t communicate as well as women. Phone calls or texts to friends and family are simple gestures that can be very comforting and meaningful.
         </li>
         <li>
          Don’t shut out family – communicate with members about your worries and concerns. Family can provide support.
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         <u>
          Advisory Team
         </u>
        </p>
        <p>
         Assemble a team of professionals to help you analyze your situation and provide suggestions. The team may include your veterinarian, nutritionist, agronomist, lender, accountant, attorney, and Extension Educator. Have these professionals come together to review your past performance, present situation, and goals for the near and short-term. Each professional brings a different perspective to the meeting based on his or her experiences and can be a valuable resource to analyze, answer questions, and provide recommendations.
        </p>
        <p>
         <u>
          Plan
         </u>
        </p>
        <p>
         What are your plans for the short-term and long-term? What Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Rewarding, and Timed (SMART) goals will get you where you want to be? Do other members of your family share the same vision?
        </p>
        <p>
         What if you decide to exit the dairy business? Do you have a written exit plan? There is life after exiting the business. Talk to your attorney and accountant about the sale and tax liabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
         <u>
          Seek Professional Help
         </u>
        </p>
        <p>
         There are trained counselors in or near your community available to help. These professionals provide confidential counseling and can suggest options to best manage your situation. Names of counselors available in your area are available by contacting your physician, local health department, pastor, or conducting an online search. Do not be ashamed to seek help!
        </p>
        <p>
         <u>
          Summary
         </u>
        </p>
        <p>
         The items presented here are not going to increase milk prices or lower input costs. However, understanding your mindset, assembling an advisory team, developing a plan, and, if necessary, reaching out to use the services of professional counselors can help you better understand your situation and make well-informed decisions.

          Title I – Commodities
         </strong>
         <strong>
          ($31.4 billion; +$0.101 billion)
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC)-County, ARC-individual, and Price Loss Coverage (PLC) are reauthorized. New program election by crop and Farm Service Agency (FSA) farm will be made for 2019 and 2020 crop years; then, starting with 2021 crop, program election can be changed each year. Failure of all producers of a FSA farm to make a unanimous election for the 2019 crop means no program payments to farm for the 2019 crop, and all the farm’s producers are defaulted for the 2020-2023 crops to the same coverage as in 2015-2018 for the covered commodity.
        </p>
        <p>
         Owners of base acres will have a 1-time opportunity to update PLC payment yields using the following formula: [(90% times average 2013-2017 yield of a covered commodity on a FSA farm) times the ratio of (average US 2008-2012 yield of a covered commodity divided by its average US 2013-2017 yield, but not less than 90% nor greater than 100% of the US yield ratio)]. Yields are per planted acre. Updated PLC yields are first used for the 2020 crop. If a farm’s yield is less than 75% of average county yield for a covered commodity in any year, then 75% of the 2013-2017 average county yield will be the farm’s yield for that year. Average payment yield for seed cotton per planted acre equals (2.4 times average yield for upland cotton per planted acre). Oilseeds designated after enactment of the farm bill will have payment yields equal to 90% of average yield per planted acre over the most recent 5 years.
        </p>
        <p>
         ARC county yields will be adjusted for trends. The trend adjustment cannot exceed crop insurance adjustment per year. Yield floor (plug yield) is raised to 80% from 70% of the county transitional yield. Insurance yield data is the first priority source of data for ARC yields. A separate irrigated and non-irrigated yield will be calculated in each county.
        </p>
        <p>
         For ARC, up to 25 counties may be divided into 2 administrative units. Eligible counties are larger than 1,400 square miles with more than 190,000 base acres. Preference is given to counties with greater variation in climate, soils, and expected productivity between the 2 administrative units.
        </p>
        <p>
         The reference price has an escalator option that results in an effective reference price used to calculate ARC and PLC payment rates. The effective reference price equals the higher of (a) the reference price stated in the farm bill (statutory reference price) for the covered commodity or (b) the escalator option of 85% of the Olympic average price of the covered commodity for 5 most recent crop years (excludes high and low price), but (c) cannot exceed 115% of the statutory reference price. The effective reference price will be used in ARC revenue guarantee calculations beginning with the 2019 crop year. Reference price for temperate japonica rice equals (1) effective reference price established for long grain rice, multiplied by the ratio of average market year price of medium grain rice to average market year price of all rice, both averages for the 2012-2016 years.
        </p>
        <p>
         No ARC or PLC payments can be received for the 2019-2023 crop years if all base acres on a farm for 2009-2017 were entirely planted to grass and pasture, including idle or fallow land. All base acres and payment yields on the farm are preserved.
        </p>
        <p>
         Nonrecourse marketing assistance loans are extended through 2023. Loan rates are increased for corn and grain sorghum ($2.20/bu.), soybeans ($6.20), wheat ($3.38/bu.), barley (2.50/bu.), oats ($2.00/bu.), extra-long staple cotton ($0.95/lb.), long and medium grain rice ($7.00/cwt.), dry peas ($6.15/cwt.), lentils ($13/cwt.), small chickpeas ($10/cwt.), large chickpeas ($14/cwt.), and raw cane sugar (19.75 cents/lb.). [ASIDE: started as a provision in the House farm bill to increase the loan rate only for extra-long staple cotton.] Secretary is given authority to adjust the marketing loan program to minimize forfeitures. Loan rate for base quality upland cotton is the simple average of adjusted prevailing world price for 2 immediately preceding market years, except its loan rate cannot decline more than 2%/year nor be lower than $0.45/lb. nor higher than $0.52/lb.
        </p>
        <p>
         Renames dairy Margin Protection Program (MPP), Dairy Margin Coverage (DMC) Program. DMC provides eligible dairy producers milk-feed cost margin coverage between $4/cwt. and $9.50/cwt. for the first 5,000,000 pounds of participating production (i.e., tier 1 production). Premiums are reduced for margins that currently exist, including a premium of $0 for the $4 margin, and are specified for the new margins of $8.50, $9.00, and $9.50. For production over 5,000,000 pounds (i.e., tier 2 production), producers can elect coverage between $4 and $8. Operations can cover between 5% and 95% of production history. Production history is the highest production in 2011, 2012, or 2013. Premiums are increased for tier 2 production, especially for higher coverage levels. Any operation that signs up in 2019 and commits to maintaining their coverage decisions through 2023 will receive a 25% discount on their premium each year. The Secretary is required to repay each dairy that participated in MPP-dairy during calendar years 2014-2017 part of the difference between total MPP-dairy premiums and payments. Repayment is (1) 75% of the difference if taken as a credit toward DMC premiums or (2) 50% of the difference if taken as cash. Dairy operations are permitted to participate in both DMC and Livestock Gross Margin for Dairy insurance (LGM) on the same milk production. All restrictions between DMC and any Federal Crop Insurance product are removed. Dairies that were locked out of the revised 2018 MPP-dairy program due to LGM participation are allowed to retroactively participate in MPP-dairy for the months during 2018 they were excluded. A study of feed costs is required; the difference in feed value of corn silage vs. corn is specifically mentioned. Monthly price reports are to be revised to include prices for high-quality alfalfa hay in the top 5 milk producing states. A Milk Donation Program is established to encourage dairy organizations to donate milk through food banks and similar organizations. Class I skim milk price formula is adjusted.
        </p>
        <p>
         Livestock Indemnity Program (LIP) is amended to cover (1) death or sale loss as a result of diseases caused or transmitted by a vector that cannot be controlled by vaccination or other acceptable management practices, and (2) death of unweaned livestock due to adverse weather.
        </p>
        <p>
         Sets Noninsured Crop Assistance Program (NAP) payment limits at $125,000 for catastrophic coverage and $300,000 for additional coverage. Service fee for NAP is increased to smaller of (1) $325 per crop per county or (2) $825 per producer per county, but cannot exceed $1,950 per producer. Authority for additional NAP coverage (also called, NAP buy-up) is made permanent.
        </p>
        <p>
         Current “actively engaged” requirements to qualify as a farm program payment entity is retained. Amends definition of family member to include first cousins, nieces, and nephews. Retains adjusted gross income (AGI) eligibility limit of $900,000. Retains $125,000 limit on PLC plus ARC payment per payment entity summed across all crops except peanuts (has its own $125,000 limit). Removes marketing loan gains and loan deficiency payments from the $125,000 payment limit.
        </p>
        <p>
         Suspension of permanent price support authorities is extended through 2023.

         <strong>
          TITLE II – CONSERVATION ($28.715 billion; +$0.555 billion)
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Increases Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) cap from 24 to 27 million acres by FY 2023, including 8.6 million acres for continuous practices and 2 million for grasslands. Contract length is 10 to 15 years, after which the land is eligible for reenrollment, with some exceptions. A proportional, historic acreage allocation by State is included for a portion of acres eligible for enrollment. Not less than 40% of continuous CRP acres are be devoted to CLEAR (Clean Lakes, Estuaries, and Rivers Initiative). Flexibility for haying and grazing is increased. Limits cost-share payments to actual cost of practice installation and may not exceed 50% of seed cost. Soil rental rates for general and continuous enrollment are respectively limited to 85% and 90% of the county average; but the Secretary is required to account for potential impact on the local farmland rental market. Authorizes incentive payments for continuous practices and forest management. Amends rental rate calculations to allow for state and Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) partner input and to maintain incentives for specific practices or areas like wellhead protection zones.
        </p>
        <p>
         Creates a pilot program for CLEAR practices that use 30-year contracts in order to measure demand for longer-term CRP contracts. Also creates a pilot Soil Health and Income Protection Program. Uses 3, 4, or 5 year agreements.
        </p>
        <p>
         Combines the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) and Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) under the same chapter, but the programs’ authorization remain separate with distinct purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
         Requires Secretary to manage CSP to enhance soil health to the maximum extent feasible. Removes current acre-based funding method and $18/acre national average payment rate. Conservation activities supported by CSP now include advanced grazing management and comprehensive conservation planning. Secretary can allocate State funding for organic and transition to organic production. Establishes a new Grassland Conservation Initiative within CSP for cropland for which base acres have been maintained by Secretary under section 1112(d)(3) of
         <em>
          Agricultural Act of 2014
         </em>
         (7 U.S.C. 9012(d)(3)). Producers are provided a 1-time election to enroll such land beginning with FY 2019. Statute specifies an annual payment rate of $18/acre. Limits enrollment in the Grassland Conservation Initiative to 1 time for a length of 5 years. Early contract termination under the Initiative is allowed at any time without penalty, and all land enrolled during a crop year is considered planted to an agricultural commodity during that crop year.
        </p>
        <p>
         Maintains EQIP’s role of helping agriculture producers meet Federal, state and local regulatory requirements. Allows Secretary to provide water conservation and system efficiency payments to certain entities eligible for implementing water conservation or irrigation practices under a watershed-wide project, such as states and irrigation districts. Reduces EQIP’s livestock allocation to 50% from 60%, clarifies that livestock activities include grazing practices, and increases EQIP’s wildlife allocation to 10% from 5%.
        </p>
        <p>
         For the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program (ACEP), narrows existing limitation on nonagricultural uses to those that negatively affect agricultural and conservation values. Expands cost-share and program eligibility. Prioritizes water quality improvement on wetland reserve easements (WRE). Land enrolled in Agricultural Land Easement (ALE) may simultaneously be enrolled in CRP.
        </p>
        <p>
         Increases mandatory funding for Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP) to $300 million/year (from $100 million/year) for FY 2019-2023 while eliminating the contribution of 7% of covered program funding. Covered programs now include EQIP, CSP, ACEP, CRP, Healthy Forest Reserve Program, and Watershed Act. Highlights water quality and quantity issues.
        </p>
        <p>
         Provides $50 million in mandatory funding to the Voluntary Public Access-Habitat Incentives Program to encourage farmers and ranchers to open their land to public recreation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Provides $50 million in annual mandatory funds for the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Program.
        </p>
        <p>
         Codifies Working Lands for Wildlife model of conservation partnership between the Departments of Agriculture and Interior to provide regulatory predictability under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 for the purpose of carrying out working landscape conservation activities involving species conservation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Provides $75 million of mandatory funds for a feral swine eradication and control pilot program for FY 2019-23.
        </p>

         IR-2019-28
        </p>
        <p>
         WASHINGTON — The Internal Revenue Service will waive the estimated tax penalty for any qualifying farmer or fisherman who files his or her 2018 federal income tax return and pays any tax due by Monday, April 15, 2019. The deadline is Wednesday, April 17, 2019, for taxpayers residing in Maine or Massachusetts.
        </p>
        <p>
         The IRS is providing this relief because, due to certain rule changes, many farmers and fishermen may have difficulty accurately determining their tax liability by the March 1 deadline that usually applies to them. For tax year 2018, an individual who received at least two-thirds of his or her total gross income from farming or fishing during either 2017 or 2018 qualifies as a farmer or fisherman.
        </p>
        <p>
         To be eligible for the waiver, qualifying taxpayers must attach
         <a href="https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-2210-f">
          Form 2210-F
         </a>
         , available on IRS.gov, to their 2018 income tax return. This form can be submitted either electronically or on paper. The taxpayer’s name and identifying number, usually a Social Security number, must be entered at the top of the form. The waiver box—Part I, Box A—should be checked. The rest of the form should be left blank.
        </p>
        <p>
         Further details can be found in Notice 2019-17, posted today on IRS.gov.

         Whether producing crops, livestock, or other agricultural products, it can be challenging if not impossible for a farmer to completely prevent dust, odors, surface water runoff, noise, and other unintended impacts. Ohio law recognizes these challenges as well as the value of agricultural production by extending legal protections to farmers. The protections are “affirmative defenses” that can shield a farmer from liability if someone files a private civil lawsuit against the farmer because of the unintended impacts of farming. A court will dismiss the lawsuit if the farmer successfully raises and proves an applicable affirmative defense.
        </p>
        <p>
         In our latest law bulletin, we summarize Ohio’s affirmative defenses that relate to production agriculture. The statutes afford legal protections based on the type of activity and the type of resulting harm. For example, one offers protections to farmers who obtain fertilizer application certification training and operate in compliance with an approved nutrient management plan, while another offers nuisance lawsuit protection against neighbors who move to an agricultural area. Each affirmative defense has different requirements a farmer must meet but a common thread among the laws is that a farmer must be a “good farmer” who is in compliance with the law and utilizing generally accepted agricultural practices. It is important for farmers to understand these laws and know how the laws apply to a farm’s production activities.
        </p>

         Do you want to do a better job of pricing your corn and soybeans? Is grain marketing a confusing and daunting task? If so, this webinar is for you!
        </p>
        <p>
         Ohio State University Extension is offering a two-session webinar focused on helping farmers become better grain marketers. Participants will have a better understanding of risk, marketing tools, and the development of written marketing plans. These workshops are funded through a North Central Risk Management Education Grant.  Additional information can be found at
         <a href="http://go.osu.edu/grainplan">
          http://go.osu.edu/grainplan
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         Participants will learn to identify their personal risk tolerance and their farm’s financial risk capacity. Both of these are important in developing a successful grain marketing plan. Participants will also learn how crop insurance products effect marketing decisions and effect risk capacity. Grain marketing consists of understanding and managing many pieces of information. Information on the different grain marketing contracts will be presented. These include basis, hedging, cash, futures, and option contracts.  Additionally, participants will be provided an example of a grain marketing plan and the fundamental principles that should be included.
        </p>
        <p>
         The courses will be offered on two consecutive Tuesdays, starting on March 12, 2019.  For specific times, as well as program registration instruction, go to
         <a href="http://www.cvent.com/d/hbqr59">

         Land is an important investment. One that is often passed down through generations. Farmland needs to be monitored and cared for to maintain the value and sustainability if it is to be enjoyed and profitable for future generations. Following the success of Lady Landowners Leaving a Legacy offered this past summer, Landowners Leaving a Legacy is open to everyone. If you want to learn more about your land, farming and conservation practices and how to successfully pass it on to the next generation, this program is for you!
        </p>
        <p>
         Farming has changed dramatically over the last several decades. The thought of trying to understand it all can be overwhelming, especially if not actively farming. This series is designed to help landowners understand critical conservation and farm management issues related to owning land. It will provide participants with the knowledge, skills and confidence to talk with tenants about farming and conservation practices used on their land. The farm management portion will provide an understanding of passing land on to the next generation and help establish fair rental rates by looking at current farm budgets. We will also visit a local farm to view practices currently implemented and hear from the landowners involved.
        </p>
        <p>
         The series runs every other Monday, February 25 – May 13 from 6:00-8:30 pm in the Champaign County Community Center Auditorium in Urbana, Ohio. It is $70 for the series. If you are only able to attend a couple of session, it is $15 per session but there is a lot of value in getting to know other participants in the series and talking with them each week. Materials and dinner included. The registration flyer can be found at

        <p>
         Upon passage and signing of the Tax Cuts Jobs Act in December 2017, Cooperatives suddenly had a decided advantage in buying over “independent” buyers of ag commodities. The new tax law had somewhat inadvertently included a “grain glitch” (which would have affected more than grain sales) that had effectively allowed for a 20% deduction on gross sales which conferred a decided advantage over sales to other non-Cooperatives. These sales to non-Cooperatives would only be allowed the QBID deduction as discussed previously in this article which effectively a 20% deduction on net income from those sales. With much hand wringing and angst in the ag sector, congress finally got around to passing a “fix” to this “glitch”.
        </p>
        <p>
         The “Consolidated Appropriations Act 2018” signed on March 23, 2018 “fixed” this inequity and but added more complexity to the reporting of sales to cooperatives. The 20-percent deduction calculated based upon their gross sales was eliminated and replaced with a hybrid Section 199A deduction. For those with sales to both cooperatives and non-cooperatives it will likely add some additional paperwork burden.
        </p>
        <p>
         To determine the IRC Section 199A Deduction for sales to cooperatives, patrons first calculate the 20 percent 199A QBI deduction that would apply if they had sold the commodity to a non-cooperative. Second, the patron must then subtract from that initial 199A deduction amount whichever of the following is smaller:
        </p>
        <ol>
         <li>
          Nine (9) percent of net income attributable to cooperative sale(s) OR
         </li>
         <li>
          Fifty (50) percent of W-2 wages paid to raise products sold to cooperatives
         </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
         Lastly, the allocable QBID deduction from the cooperative (up to 9%).
        </p>
        <p>
         Sales to coops may result in a net QBI Deduction. The net deduction may be greater than 20% if the farmer taxpayer pays no W2 wages and the cooperative passes through all or a large portion of the allocable QBI to the patron. Or the net deduction may be equal to 20% if the farmer taxpayer pays enough W2 wages to fully limit their coop sales QBI deduction to 11% and the coop passes through all allocable QBI.  Or the net deduction may be less than 20% if farmer taxpayer pays enough W2 wages to fully limit their coop sales QBI to 11% and the coop passes through less than the allocable QBI.
        </p>
        <p>
         The following examples illustrate how patrons calculate the QBI deduction at the indi­vidual level.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          QBI Deduction for Co-op Patron’s Sales—No Wages Paid
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Pat Patron, a single taxpayer, is a member patron of Big Co-op. In 2018, he sold all his grain through Big Co-op. Big Co-op paid Pat a $230,000 per-unit retain paid in money (PURPIM) and a $20,000 end-of-year patronage dividend. Thus, in 2018, Pat received $250,000 ($230,000 + $20,000) from Big Co-op for his grain sales. Pat also had $200,000 in expenses, which did not include any W-2 wages. Pat had no capital gain income in 2018, but he received wages from an outside job. His taxable income was $75,000.
        </p>
        <p>
         Pat’s 2018 QBI is $50,000 ($250,000 − $200,000). Pat calculates a $10,000 (20% × $50,000) tentative QBI deduction. Pat’s taxable income is below the $157,500 threshold for single taxpayers, so his QBI deduction is not limited by the W-2 wages limitation. Because all of Pat’s ten­tative QBI deduction is attributable to qualified payments he received from Big Co-op, Pat must reduce his QBI deduction by the lesser of
        </p>
        <ol>
         <li>
          $4,500 (9% × $50,000), or
         </li>
         <li>
          $0 (50% of $0 W-2 wages attributable to Pat’s co-op payments)
         </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
         Because Pat paid no wages for his grain busi­ness, he does not have to reduce his QBI deduc­tion. Pat claims the $10,000 QBI deduction.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Pass-Through Deduction
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that in 2018, Big Co-op also allocated a $2,500 deduction to Pat for his share of the co-op’s QPAI. The deduction does not exceed Pat’s tax­able income after subtracting his QBI deduction ($75,000 − $10,000 = $65,000). Pat’s QBI deduc­tion is $12,500 ($10,000 + $2,500).
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          QBI Deduction for Co-op Patron’s Sales—With Wages
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that $25,000 of Pat’s $200,000 in expenses were W-2 wages that he paid to an employee. Pat’s tentative QBI deduction is still $10,000 (20% × $50,000). However, he must reduce his QBI deduction by the lesser of the following:
        </p>
        <ol>
         <li>
          $4,500 (9% × $50,000) or
         </li>
         <li>
          $12,500 (50% × $25,000) Pat has a $5,500 QBI deduction ($10,000 − $4,500).
         </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Transition Rules for Sales to Cooperatives
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Also as part of the “grain glitch” fix in March of this year, a transition rule was included in the Code regarding qualified payments made by a cooperative with a year that began in 2017 and ended in 2018 (Fiscal Year Cooperative). This provision indicates that any payments received by a patron (farmer) during 2018 that is also included in the cooperatives taxable year ending in 2018 is not allowed to be used in calculating Section 199A.
        </p>
        <p>
         The farmer will simply receive the DPAD passed through by the cooperative for that year (if any) and be allowed to only deduct that on their tax return. None of the qualified payments made to the farmer during the cooperatives fiscal year ending in 2018 are allowed for QBI. In other words, the farmer selling products to a cooperative with a fiscal year ending sometime in 2018 prior to December 31, 2018 will not be able to claim the sales prior to the fiscal year end date as QBI for purposes of the QBI deduction. Not a great deal for farmers with sales to cooperatives prior to the cooperative’s fiscal year end date.
        </p>
        <p>
         Many cooperatives issued a Section 199 DPAD deduction in December of 2017. This means that these farmers got a deduction in 2017 when rates were higher, however, due to the transition provision, these farmers will perhaps not qualify for much, if any Section 199A deduction in 2018 AND not receive any DPAD from the cooperative since it was “pushed” out in 2017. This is what we may call a “double whammy.”  The reason it may be so drastic is that many grain farmers receive most of the proceeds from their grain sales in the first few months of the year and then simply have little or no sales the remaining part of the year.
        </p>
        <p>
         The bottom line is that farmers who sell to a cooperative may not get the deduction they were planning on this year due to the transition rule.
        </p>
        <p>
         This also means that the cooperative will need to report to the patron the amount of qualified payments made to the patron in 2018 that was included in the cooperative’s Section 199 computation from January 1, 2018 to the last day of the cooperative’s fiscal year ending in 2018.

        <p>
         by: Barry Ward, Director, OSU Income Tax Schools &amp; Leader, Production Business Management
        </p>
        <p>
         The new tax law known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) was signed into law on December 22, 2017 and will affect income tax returns for all of us for 2018 (to be filed in the next few months). The headline pieces of the new tax law include new tax brackets, higher standard deductions, elimination of personal exemptions and a new corporate flat tax rate of 21%. This will amount to lower total federal income tax for the large majority of taxpayers and C-corporations. Parts of the new tax law will make tax preparation simpler while parts will add complexity to the process.
        </p>
        <p>
         With the new lower tax rate for corporations (specifically C-corporations) of 21% (a flat 21% rate) this replaces the old graduated tax brackets for C-corporations that started at 15% and topped out at 35%. The new lower tax rate for C-corporations may have created a decidedly uneven playing field if the new tax law hadn’t included a new deduction for all other businesses. This new Qualified Business Income Deduction (QBID) (sometimes referred to as the Pass-Through Deduction) is a 20% deduction of a businesses’ Qualified Business Income (QBI). Without this, businesses across the U.S. would have been strongly considering a change to a C-Corp structure for income tax purposes. With this QBID, the playing field between the different tax entities is mostly re-leveled. There may be inequalities that show up with the new tax law as it relates to business entity selection but it may take some time for these inequalities to reveal themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
         The new Qualified Business Income Deduction is laid out in Section 199A of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). This new deduction has also been referred to as the 199A Deduction, the §199A Deduction for Pass-through Entities, the Business Deduction, the QBI Deduction, the Pass-through Entity Deduction, the Pass-through Business Deduction and other names. Each of these names refers to the same new deduction.
        </p>
        <p>
         The QBID is a deduction in the amount of 20% that is allowed for “pass through entities” – sole proprietorships, partnerships, and S corporations (Limited Liability Companies (LLCs) filing as one of the afore-mentioned are included).
        </p>
        <p>
         To qualify for this 20% deduction, qualified business income must be earned from what is termed a “qualified trade or business.” The deduction reduces taxable income and is 20% of “qualified business income” (or 20% of taxable ordinary income, whichever is less). The deduction is claimed on the individual’s tax returns whether an individual itemizes or does not itemize personal deductions on Schedule A. This deduction is classified as a “below-the-line” deduction as it is taken after adjusted gross income is calculated.
        </p>
        <p>
         Net Farm Income from Schedule F qualifies for this deduction. Depreciation recapture income and certain rental income also qualifies. Capital gains income does not qualify. The key consideration for farmers is that Net Farm Profit (if any) from Schedule F does qualify for the deduction.
        </p>
        <p>
         For higher income filers there are limitation phase-ins for this deduction. This deduction is fully available for individuals with taxable income of less than $157,500 for single filers and less than $315,000 for joint filers. (Filers above these thresholds can also qualify if they meet certain criteria.) The deductible amount for EACH qualified trade or business is 20% of the taxpayers qualified business income (QBI) with respect to each trade or business or 20% of the taxpayer’s taxable income, whichever is less.
        </p>
        <p>
         Example:
        </p>
        <p>
         You are a sole-proprietor (married filing jointly) and you make $100,000 in net farm income (Schedule F Income) but with the new standard deduction ($24,000) your taxable income is $76,000 (assume the Schedule F net farm income is the sole source of income).
        </p>
        <p>
         Your deduction is the lesser of:
        </p>
        <p>
         20% of $100,000 = $20,000
        </p>
        <p>
         20% of $76,000 = $15,200
        </p>
        <p>
         Deduction is $15,200
        </p>
        <p>
         Your taxable income in this simple example will be $60,800 ($100,000 -$24,000 – $15,200).
        </p>
        <p>
         The QBID is limited for taxpayers with QBI over the threshold amounts of $157,500 for single filers and $315,000 for joint filers. Taxpayers with QBI over these need wages paid (W-2 wages paid) and/or depreciable property to qualify. This “depreciable property” is technically referred to as “Unadjusted basis immediately after acquisition of qualified property” or “UBIA of qualified property” or UBIA for short.
        </p>
        <p>
         The limitation phase-in ranges are $50,000 for single filers and $100,000 for joint filers which means the limitation phase-in ranges for a single filer is $157,000 – $207,000 and the limitation phase-in range for joint filers is $315,000 – $415,000.
        </p>
        <p>
         So….once $157,000 and $315,000 are reached, a limitation on the deduction is phased in over the ranges of $50,000 for single filers and $100,000 for joint filers. Taxpayers with taxable income that fall in this limitation phase-in range are subject to a ratable phase-in of the wage and capital limitation which we discuss next.
        </p>
        <p>
         Once filers reach the top of the phase out ranges ($207,500 for single filers and $415,000 for joint filers) the calculations are relatively simple. The deduction is the lesser of:
        </p>
        <ol>
         <li>
          QBI for the trade of business (20% x Qualified Business Income) and:
         </li>
         <li>
          The greater of:
         </li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
         <li>
          50% of the W-2 wages paid by the business or
         </li>
         <li>
          The sum of 25% of the W-2 wages with respect to the trade or business and 2.5% of the depreciable property (UBIA).
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         Example:
        </p>
        <p>
         You are a sole-proprietor (married filing jointly) and you have $500,000 of Net Farm Income (Schedule F Income) but with the new standard deduction ($24,000) your taxable income is $476,000 (assume the Schedule F net farm income is the sole source of income). Assume they pay W-2 wages of $60,000 and have depreciable property of $1.2 million.
        </p>
        <p>
         As they are above the top end of the limitation phase-in range ($415,000 for joint filers), their QBID will be limited to the lesser of 20% of the QBI ($500,000 x 20% = $100,000) or the greater of the two possible wage/UBIA limiting calculations. We can calculate the potential QBID using both methods and take the higher of the two.
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          $60,000 * 50% = $30,000
         </li>
         <li>
          ($60,000 * 25%) + ($1,200,000 * 2%) =
          <strong>
           $39,000
          </strong>
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         <span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">
          We compare the greater of the two ($39,000) to the unlimited QBID of $100,000 and take the lesser of the two or $39,000.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         The QBID deduction will be $39,000 for this farm business and for this taxpayer assuming 20% of the Taxable Income isn’t less than this. Taxable income of $476,000 * 20% equals $95,200 therefore the QBID for this tax return will be $39,000 and the Taxable Income will be $437,00 ($500,000 – $24,000 – $39,000).
        </p>
        <p>
         For purposes of the QBID we provide more details on depreciable property to calculate the QBID in and above the phase-out ranges.
        </p>
        <p>
         What is the depreciable property (UBIA) for purposes of the QBID? This is defined as tangible property, subject to depreciation (meaning inventory doesn’t count), which is held by the business at the end of the year and is used — at ANY point in the year — in the production of QBI. But there’s a catch: if you’re going to count the basis towards your limitation, the “depreciable period” of the period could not have ended prior to the last day of the year for which you are trying to take the deduction.
        </p>
        <p>
         The depreciable period starts on the date the property is placed in service and ends on the LATER OF:  10 years, or the last day of the last full year in the asset’s “regular” (not ADS) depreciation period.
        </p>
        <p>
         To illustrate, assume Ohio Farm purchases a piece of machinery on November 18, 2018 for 100,000. The machinery is used in the business, and is depreciated over 5 years. Even though the depreciable life of the asset is only 5 years, the owners of Ohio Farm will be able to take the unadjusted basis of $100,000 into consideration for purposes of this second limitation for ten full years, from 2018-2027, because the qualifying period runs for the LONGER of the useful life (5 years) OR 10 years.
        </p>
        <p>
         The basis taken into consideration is “unadjusted basis,” meaning it is NOT reduced by any depreciation deductions. In fact, Internal Revenue Code Section (§) 199A(b)(2)(B)(ii) requires that you take into consideration the basis of the property “immediately after acquisition”. Any asset that was fully depreciated prior to 2018, unless it was placed in service after 2008, will not count towards basis.
        </p>
        <p>
         Just as with W-2 wages, a shareholder or partner may only take into consideration for purposes of applying the limitation, 2.5% of his or her allocable share of the basis of the property. So if the total basis of S corporation property is $1,000,000 and you are a 20% shareholder, your basis limitation is $1,000,000 * 20% * 2.5% = $5,000.
        </p>
        <p>
         If you are a partner in a partnership, you must allocate your share of asset basis in the same manner in which you are allocated depreciation expense from the partnership.
        </p>
        <p>
         Special rules apply for sales to cooperatives and farmland lease income and will be covered in a subsequent articles.

        <p>
         2019 is upon us and you may be meeting soon with your lender to discuss financial needs for the year. We all know agriculture is suffering from poor economic conditions – and the outlook for many sectors of the industry doesn’t look real promising. A variety of factors are forcing lenders to be more critical of loan applications. Let’s review a few things you can do to assist your lender as they review your loan application.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
         A year-end Balance Sheet is very helpful and provides a snapshot of the assets, liabilities, and net worth of your farm. Get in the habit of completing one each year for your lender to keep on file and for your own reference so you can monitor changes over time. You can get a blank balance sheet from your lender or access one here:

          Goals
         </u>
         :
        </p>
        <p>
         Why are you requesting money from your lender? What is your goal(s)? What are you hoping to accomplish with the money you are requesting? Will you use the money as an operating loan to plant your crops? Are you planning an expansion? Are you wanting to consolidate existing debt? Regardless of the reason, your lender is going to need to know how you plan to repay the loan. A budget and cash flow projections will help everyone understand how the money will be used and how it will be repaid. Research has proven that you are more likely to accomplish your goals if they are written. Be sure your goals are Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Rewarding, and Timed (SMART). See this Ohio State University Extension fact sheet for information about writing SMART goals:

          Tax Returns
         </u>
         :
        </p>
        <p>
         Your lender may request copies of your tax returns. Make sure you categorize income and expenses the same way each year. This allows the lender to compare apples-to-apples when evaluating your historic income and expenses. Also, if you pre-pay expenses or defer income, make sure your lender is aware of this so they can make accrual adjustments.
        </p>
        <p>
         <u>
          Communication
         </u>
         :
        </p>
        <p>
         Communication with your lender is critical. Your lender is interested in understanding your farm, knowing how you are progressing, and what your plans are for the short and long-term. Invite your lender to visit the farm for a tour, a ride in the tractor, or to assist with milking!
        </p>

          Business Plan
         </u>
         :
        </p>
        <p>
         Every lender would love to see each client have a written business plan. A business plan is made up of five parts: Executive Summary, Description, Operations, Marketing Plan, and Financial Plan. The University of Minnesota Extension has a template available at the following site:

         The Central Ohio Precision Ag Symposium will be held on Wednesday, January 16, 2019 at All Occasions Catering 6986 Waldo-Delaware Rd., Waldo Ohio from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.  This year’s program will feature the most current technologies available in precision agriculture. These topics will be shared by some of the leading university and industry Precision Ag experts.
        </p>
        <p>
         This year’s program opens with a discussion regarding where we are in Precision Ag today – “The Adoption of Precision Ag Technologies” – Jack Zemlicka, Ag Division Content Director Lessiter Media and ends with a look into the crystal ball – “The Future of Precision Ag” – Dr. Scott Shearer, The Ohio State University.
        </p>
        <p>
         Data management is a “hot “topic in today precision agriculture.  Dr. John Fulton will share his insights on “Data Considerations in Today’s Crop Production”.  You will learn about data security and who can/has access to your data at afternoon breakout sessions from Climate-Fieldview, Agleader–Agfinity, and My JohnDeere.  Learn about the value of your data and opportunities for selling your data at one of the Farm Mobile breakout sessions.
        </p>
        <p>
         Artificial intelligence is changing our industry.  Tim Norris will discuss “AI” and share insights from Knox County’s first autonomous tractor.  “AI” will be part of several other afternoon breakout sessions as well.  New datum changes are scheduled for 2022.  Jeff Jalbrzikowski will explain how this change could potentially affect our current maps and GPS positioning files.
        </p>
        <p>
         “To be the premier source of research-based information in the age of digital agriculture” is the vision of the Ohio State Digital Ag Program.  Dr. Elizabeth Hawkins will discuss the nearly 100 OSU on-farm research trials conducted throughout Ohio in 2018.  Everyone in attendance will receive a copy of the 2018 eFields Report.
