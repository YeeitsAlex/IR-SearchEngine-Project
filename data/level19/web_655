              The types of data we collect are mainly driven by the extent to which you either provide information to Rice, or to the extent you use Rice programs or services.  As you attend Rice, in person or online, we may collect information about your participation and performance, including information such as the courses you take, your grade or performance in a course, and information about your attendance or participation.
             </p>
             <p>
              If you use an online learning platform (such as Canvas, EdX, Coursera, OpenStax Tutor), information about your online activities will be associated with your log in, which may include what pages you visit, how long you were there, forum postings, and any correspondence with the instructor or other students.
             </p>
             <p>
              If you use other Rice services or programs, we may collect personal information from you that is relevant to providing that service or program. Examples of these services and programs include academic advising, career services, financial aid, work study, health center or counseling, athletics, disability services, library, information technology, housing, dining, parking, wellness center, clubs and student activities, student judicial programs, equal opportunity or Title IX coordinators, police or emergency medical services.
             </p>
             <p>
              Importantly, there are laws that affect how your data may be used or shared by Rice, and may provide you with additional rights. The primary law affecting student information is the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), which is a federal law designed to protect the privacy of and limit access to student educational records (as defined in that law).  In some cases, FERPA allows certain information to be shared without your permission. More information about FERPA is available at

              Rice may collect your personal data in a number of ways, including you providing it to Rice as part of an employment application or during the hiring process.

Other examples of these services or programs include payroll, library, human resources, disability services, information technology,, dining, parking, recreation center, equal opportunity or Title IX, police or emergency medical services.
