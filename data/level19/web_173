        <h3>
         How do I schedule an appointment?
        </h3>
        <p>
         Career advising appointments can be made by logging into your Hire-A-Niner account. On the Hire-A-Niner homepage, 
							click "Meet with Your Career Advisor" in the Quick Links box. Be sure to check your e-mail for confirmation of your appointment.
        </p>
        <h3>
         What is the resume approval process?
        </h3>
        <p>
         In an effort to maintain positive relationships with our employers and help you present yourself professionally, we require each student to have an approved resume before submitting it for many jobs and internships, 
								on-campus interviews, and resume books. Review the
         <a href="https://career.uncc.edu/accordions/write-resume">
          Resume Approval Checklist
         </a>
         carefully before submitting your resume.
         <p>
          The first time you upload your resume into Hire-A-Niner, your resume will be held for review by our staff. The review process takes 1-2 business days. 
								Once your resume is reviewed, you will receive an email letting you know whether or not it has been approved. If changes are needed, you will receive individual feedback about your resume.
								Once you have an approved resume in Hire-A-Niner, you can upload additional documents without needing approval.
