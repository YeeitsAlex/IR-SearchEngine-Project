      Overview
     </h1>
     <p>
      The OSU Student Logging Training Program is an opportunity within the College of Forestry for interested students seeking a degree in Forestry, Forest Engineering, or Forest Engineering/Civil Engineering, looking to gain real-life training in practical logging skills.
     </p>
     <p>
      The SLTP provides a unique opportunity to experience real world logging applications, primarily on the McDonald-Dunn College Forest, just 15 minutes north of campus.
     </p>
     <p>
      The student-crew utilizes a range of modern equipment logging equipment including a Koller 501 Yarder, Link Belt loader and a John Deere skidder. In addition, students become proficient using power saws to fall and buck timber.

        The crew reinforces many of the tools that you learn through on the job experience; it's not simply an academic exercise. You get the full picture from planning to harvesting, then site prep and planting. Having the knowledge is important, but being able to apply it in the field is what employers are looking for. Having applied these practices through the crew I am more comfortable and confident in my work.
