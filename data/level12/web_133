      Environmental Sciences
     </h1>
     <p>
      The Environmental Sciences major includes courses mainly offered through the College of Sciences. Some courses are offered outside of the College of Sciences to give the major an interdisciplinary approach. The goal of this program is to understand how vegetation, soils, climate, water, and human activities interact within a spatial context and apply this knowledge to real-world problems.
     </p>
     <h2>
      Program Overview
     </h2>
     <p>
      Environmental Sciences is an interdisciplinary Bachelor of Sciences program. The program provides students with a rigorous and arcing foundation in natural and biological sciences most relevant to environmental issues. While the focus is on physical environmental sciences, some required coursework includes: biology, computer science, geography, and statistics. The theme of Environmental Sciences is to combine multiple disciplines in order to solve complex problems. Those students wishing to concentrate more on the biological aspects of the environment should consider the Ecology emphasis offered by the Department of Biology.
     </p>
     <h2>
      Special Features
     </h2>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Upon completion of the degree, students will be prepared to confront real-world problems through the gathering and disseminating of environmental information.
      </li>
      <li>
       This major is especially attractive to students who wish to obtain a broader background in natural sciences and biological sciences, or students who wish to take an interdisciplinary approach to natural and biological sciences.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h2>
      Career Opportunities
     </h2>
     <p>
      This major will prepare the student for employment in diverse situations in the dynamic and ever-changing Environmental Sciences job market. A range of opportunities for employment is present when a student is able to comprehend and apply more than one scientific discipline in a workplace situation. Environmental Sciences is also an excellent stepping-stone for students planning to pursue a Master's or PhD in one of the natural sciences.
