      Who we are
     </h3>
     <p>
      The Caltech - Occidental Wind Orchestra is comprised of select performers of wind and percussion instruments drawn from the undergraduate and graduate student population at Caltech and Occidental College, plus faculty, alumni, staff and community members from Caltech, and the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratories (JPL). Currently numbering at approximately 80 musicians, this group rehearses once per week and performs three programs of repertoire per academic year. The repertoire is selected from the finest traditional and contemporary music from around the world.
     </p>
     <p>
      The ensemble (formerly known as the Concert Band) earned great acclaim under the leadership of William Bing, who directed the group for over 40 years. Drawing upon the tremendous talent base of Los Angeles, the group has featured such guest artists as Allen Vizzuti, David Shifrin, Eddie Daniels, Jim Self, Wayne Bergeron and Frank Ticheli. The group has taken on notable recording projects, and tours to such locations as Carnegie Hall and China. Appointed in 2016 as conductor of the ensemble and Director of Performing and Visual Arts, Glenn Price is building on the heritage, tradition and high standards established by Bill Bing.
