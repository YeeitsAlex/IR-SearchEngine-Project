               In order to better trouble shoot problems, you may be asked to confirm your phone
                                          number. You can still receive an alert even if your phone number is not confirmed.

                                          is not required to receive an alert.

                                       on the part of the UGA community. Examples include chemical spills, tornado warnings,

                                       will also be used to provide additional information or to issue an "all clear" announcement.
                                       However, to be sure the system is working properly and to remind enrollees to check
                                       their contact information for accuracy, two test messages will be sent each year.
                                       One will be initiated in connection with the annual statewide severe weather drill
                                       in February and the other will occur near the beginning of fall semester to ensure
                                       incoming freshmen know how the system works.

              Yes. Because it is impossible to track which UGA students, faculty, and staff may
                                       be on the campus at any given time, when an emergency situation warrants use of this
                                       system, the warning will be issued regardless of the time of day or night. For example,
                                       if a tornado warning is issued for Athens-Clarke County at 3am,UGA

                                       live in a surrounding county that is not under a tornado warning, the numbers you
                                       reflected will still be called. It is important to keep this in mind when entering
                                       your emergency contact information.

              Although college campuses are usually safe places, emergencies and disasters do occur.
                                       Individual preparedness is the cornerstone of emergency preparedness and response.
                                       Every individual should have an emergency kit and emergency plan-including a family
                                       communication plan. The plan should be tested periodically. Each campus office and

               Opt-in lists are the lists created to allow users on the Tifton, Griffin, Gwinnett,
                                          and Skidaway campuses to sign up for alerts for those campuses. Currently, all UGAAlert
                                          users are defaulted to the Athens campus. New users in Griffin, Gwinnett, Tifton,
                                          and Skidaway will need to click on the Opt-in List tab and subscribe to alerts for
                                          their campus. When information from the data warehouse becomes available, we hope
                                          to default users to the correct campus, but that information is not currently available.
