Baker Jr.","content":"Senator Howard H. Baker Jr. Howard Henry Baker, Jr. was born November 15, 1925, in Huntsville, Tennessee. As a young man, Baker did not have political ambitions, but he served as president of the UT student body, and graduated from UT Law school in 1949. This followed his service in the Navy and earlier dreams of becoming an engineer or pilot. Upon graduation he practiced law in Huntsville and in 1964 he ran for the US Senate in a special election to fill the vacancy created when Senator Estes Kefauver died. Despite his loss in 1964, he ran again in 1966. Baker won 56 percent of the popular vote and became Tennessee   s first popularly elected Republican senator, and he went on to serve three terms as a Tennessee senator, from 1967 until his retirement in 1985. During his career in the Senate, Baker became known as    The Great Conciliator    for his ability to bring lawmakers from both political parties together to resolve pressing issues. He rose to national prominence during the Watergate hearings of 1973-1974 as Vice Chairman of the Senate Watergate Committee, when he uttered that famous question, What did the President know and when did he know it? He served as Senate Majority Leader and Minority Leader, and he was a candidate for the 1980 Republican presidential nomination. In 1987-88, he served as President Ronald Reagan   s Chief of Staff and effectively dealt with a growing scandal within the Reagan Administration, known as the Iran Contra Affair. He retired again to travel and practice law, before being appointed in in 2001 by President George W. Bush as US Ambassador to Japan. In 2005, he retired once again and returned to Tennessee to work with his law firm, Baker Donelson in Huntsville, TN. He devoted much time to the Baker Center, offering insight and suggestions from his long and illustrious career. Sen. Baker married Joy Dirksen, daughter of Sen. Everett Dirksen, in 1951 and they had two children, Darek and Cissy Baker. Joy passed away in 1993 after a long battle with cancer. In 1996, he married Sen. Nancy Landon Kassebaum and they resided in Huntsville, Tennessee and Morris County, Kansas. Sen. Baker passed away on June 26, 2014 at the age of 88 in Huntsville, Tennessee. He was in repose in the Rotunda of the Baker Center for the public on Monday, June 30 and a funeral was held in Huntsville on Tuesday, July 1. The funeral was attended by family, friends and many Washington dignitaries including Vice President Joe Biden, Vice President Al Gore, Sen. Fred Thompson, Sen. Harry Reid and Sen. Lamar Alexander, who provided the eulogy.  flickr_photostream user_id= 138055248@N06  ","link":"http:\/\/bakercenter.utk.edu\/howard-baker-jr-bio\/"},{"title":"Baker Center Alumni","content":"Baker Center Alumni ","link":"http:\/\/bakercenter.utk.edu\/baker-center-alumni\/"},{"title":"The Baker Scholars Program","content":"The Baker Scholars Program Since its inception in 2004, the Baker Scholars program has consistently attracted the University of Tennessee   s most academically gifted, politically curious students by offering a unique and meaningful opportunity for engagement in the field of public policy.

Tennessee  Intercollegiate  State  Legislature The Tennessee Intercollegiate State Legislature (TISL) is a forum for the top echelon of the state   s campus leaders to exchange ideas, express their opinions and learn how government works. TISL   s Senate and House of Representatives, which first convened in 1966, meet in the legislative chambers of the State Capitol each November. The judicial branch of TISL is the Tennessee Intercollegiate Supreme Court, which presides over the Appellate Moot Court Collegiate Challenge (AMC3). Colleges form teams of two to five members to prepare a brief and argue for the petitioner and respondent before the Court. Producers, editors and reporters of TISL Media communicate in a variety of ways about events at TISL. Current initiatives include videos, a printed newsletter at the General Assembly, blogging and Twitter. Student officers, selected by their peers, play a primary role in running TISL programs throughout the year.","link":"http:\/\/bakercenter.utk.edu\/partners\/"},{"title":"Facility Rental Information","content":"Facility Rental Information The Baker Center is located at 1640 Cumberland Avenue on the University of Tennessee campus.

Baker Jr. Center for Public Policy was established in 2003 with a Congressionally-funded endowment and a mission to educate and promote research to further the public   s knowledge of our system of governance, and to highlight the critical importance of public service. Sen. Howard Baker and a dedicated board assisted the staff of four, led by Director Alan Lowe, to grow and develop the Baker Center.   From its humble beginnings in Hoskins Library on the UT Campus, to its move into a 51,000 square foot facility on Cumberland Avenue in 2008, the Center focused on four main areas  public programs, archives, research, and civic education and engagement. In 2005, plans were announced to build a new facility to house the Baker Center. The building would include a museum on government, a 100 collection archives, classrooms and meeting rooms.   A ground-breaking ceremony was held with Vice President Dick Cheney and then the building was dedicated in 2008 with Supreme Court Justice (Ret.) Sandra Day O   Connor. The staff expanded to eight to run the facility, promote the museum and administer the new Modern Political Archives (MPA). In 2009, Alan Lowe left to become director of the George W. Bush Presidential Library and Carl Pierce, UT Law professor, was appointed director. Concurrently, various task forces reviewed the mission of the Baker Center and in 2012 the museum was closed and converted into offices for the Chancellor   s Honors Program and the Modern Political Archives was turned over to UT Libraries Special Collections. As a result, staff was reduced and segments of the museum were moved into locations throughout the building, where they can be viewed today. In 2012, Dr. Matt Murray, Associate Director of the UT Boyd Center for Business & Economic Research, was appointed director of the Baker Center. A revised mission and new focus on policy research in the areas of Energy and the Environment, Global Security, and Leadership and Governance, was adopted, along with academic courses and additional student engagement programs. The mission of the center is to    Provide policy makers, citizens, scholars, and students with the information and skills necessary to work effectively within our political system and to educate our local, state, national, and global communities. Sen. Baker continued to be engaged with the Baker Center until his death on June 26, 2014. However, his leadership and support provided such a strong foundation that the Center is well situated to continue his legacy as a place for civil, bipartisan discussion of the issues affecting us all.

Dr. Machlis  book will be available for purchase at the event. Inducing Demand  Why Consumer-Level Approaches to Conservation Often Fail Dr. Richard York Thursday, March 7    1 00pm    Toyota Auditorium   Howard Baker Center Dr. Richard York is a Professor of Environmental Studies and Sociology at the University of Oregon. He does both theoretical and empirical work in the areas of environmental sociology, ecological economics, animal studies, political economy, and the sociology of science. His talk will discuss the various theoretical reasons why alternative energy sources often do not suppress fossil fuel use and why efficiency does not lead to conservation, as part of the Howard H. Baker Center s  Energy and  Environment Forum. Data Science in the Energy Sector Dr. Jacob LaRiviere April 12-13, 2019 l 9am-5pm     Howard Baker Center Dr. Jacob LaRiviere is a senior research economist at Microsoft in the Office of the Chief Economist.   His research interests include Industrial Organization, Environmental & Energy Economics, and Behavioral Economics. He also serves as adjunct professor of Economics at the University of Tennessee and is a Fellow at the Baker Center for Public Policy. This course will cover  essentials  of machine learning and econometrics with applications design for energy and electricity sector practitioners and  policy makers.   The course will be couched using the economic framework of  benefit-cost  analysis and will then move to teach supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques. We will pay special attention to clearly delineating causal inference versus prediction. Finally, the course will include components involving database management, data science hiring procedures and attend to the decision of using vendors versus in house resources to enable and scale  data driven  decision making.   At a high level, this course will have a similar flavor to an executive education course in a business school, however, due to the technical nature of the  subject  it will be slightly technical when required by the material. This machine learning course will be offered at the Howard H. Baker Jr. Center for Public Policy on the campus of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.   The cost is $950 and includes complimentary breakfast, refreshments, and lunches.   Lodging is available at additional cost at nearby hotels.

Baker Jr., former US senator whose ability to work with Democratic and Republican lawmakers earned him the nickname of    The Great Conciliator,    died on Thursday, June 26, 2014. He was eighty-eight. Baker earned his law degree from UT in 1949. The Howard H. Baker Jr. Center for Public Policy at UT was founded in 2003 as a nonpartisan institute devoted to education and research concerning public policy and civic engagement. Baker received the university   s first honorary doctorate in spring 2005.    Our country has lost a great statesman and a great Tennessean. Senator Baker will live on in our hearts forever as a man who believed that government was to serve the people,    Chancellor Jimmy G. Cheek said. To many, Baker symbolized the civility and bipartisanship of a bygone political era, one where lawmakers from both parties set aside personal convictions and party ideology to work together in the public interest.    For Senator Baker, principle was more important than politics in his work. It was about doing the right thing. I have a great appreciation for the role Senator Baker played in terms of his bipartisan approach to policy, as well as the demeanor he carried with him in debate. The words    civic engagement    really do characterize his perspective on political discourse and how it should take place in this country,    said Matt Murray, director of the Baker Center. Remembering Senator Baker People from around the world share their memories of Senator Baker and we highlight Senator Baker   s legacy on American politics in these video clips. Elected to the US Senate in 1966   and then re-elected in 1972 and 1978   Baker   s diplomatic style was instrumental in the passage of such bipartisan efforts as the Panama Canal Treaty, the Clean Air Act, and the Clean Water Act. But his position as Senate minority leader, and later Senate majority leader, was anything but easy, and Baker famously commented that leading the Senate was like    herding cats.    But Baker   s ability to work with politicians across the political spectrum impressed President Ronald Reagan enough for him to personally ask Baker to become his chief of staff in 1987, when goodwill between Congress and the White House was at a low point following the Iran-Contra scandal. Baker is credited with greatly repairing the relationship between the two branches. Straight Out of Tennessee Howard Henry Baker Jr. was born in Huntsville, Tennessee, on November 15, 1925. His father, Howard H. Baker Sr., served as a state representative and a district attorney general during Baker   s childhood. His mother, Dora Ladd Baker, died when Baker was a child  several years later, his father married Irene Bailey. From 1950 until his death in 1964, Howard Baker Sr. served in the US House of Representatives  when he died, Irene took his place and served out the rest of his term. As a young man Baker showed little interest in pursuing a political career, planning instead to become a lawyer like his father and grandfather before him. After graduating from a military preparatory school in 1943, he enlisted in the US Navy as part of its V-12 officer training program. At the conclusion of his tenure in the navy, Baker earned his law degree.    Senator Baker is our college   s most illustrious alumnus and has made such a difference for the country, the state, and the university. He represents the best of what we do, thanks to his commitment to the legal profession and his commitment to community,    said Doug Blaze, dean of UT   s College of Law. In 1951, Baker married Joy Dirksen, the daughter of US Senator Everett Dirksen of Illinois. After helping run his father   s successful 1950 congressional campaign, Baker settled down to practice law, joining the law firm founded by his grandfather in 1888. But after the death of his father, Baker began to make forays into the political world. In 1964 he ran   albeit unsuccessfully    against Ross Bass to fill the US Senate seat left vacant by the death of Senator Estes Kefauver. But in 1966 he won the election for that same seat, marking the beginning of his three terms as US senator from Tennessee. Personal Politics When he ran for re-election in 1972, Baker touted his friendship and close working relationship with President Richard Nixon. Thus, Baker found himself in an awkward position a year later when he became chair of the Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities, also known as the Senate Watergate Committee. But despite his personal admiration for Nixon, Baker maintained impartiality and pressed for information during the hearings, asking the now famous question,    What did the president know, and when did he know it?    In the decades following Watergate, Baker maintained that he believed Nixon did not know about the break-in  however, Baker added that when Nixon did find out about the incident he failed to act appropriately. Baker   s ability to place his civic duty above his personal convictions impressed his colleagues in the Senate, and he was elected Republican minority leader in 1977 and majority leader in 1981. As majority leader Baker brokered many complex deals between Congress and the White House, often garnering bipartisan support among his colleagues for compromises on issues like spending cuts and tax hikes. Murray says Baker   s bipartisan approach to policy is sorely lacking in today   s political landscape.    He played a big role in helping push the Clean Air Act through Congress. As a Republican in a southern state to push so hard on an agenda that may have been viewed as being liberal, or counter to business, his was a signature action to protect the environment. You   d be hard pressed today to find leadership in Congress to take a stand like that,    Murray stated. Baker said that his ability to convince other senators to work with him mostly stemmed from his non-confrontational, friendly approach.    One Republican senator was quoted as saying, when I went  to become White House chief of staff ,    I don   t know how Baker got along so well with the Senate. All he ever did was get members in the cloakroom and tell them a funny story, and then they   d just do whatever it was he wanted.    Which of course isn   t true, but it makes another point, which is that legislation and governance is a very personal matter. I believed in the personality of politics,    Baker stated. Baker did not seek re-election in 1984. Murray noted that while Baker stayed true to his principles in the Senate, he did pay a    political price    for some of his efforts, such as the Panama Canal treaty and environmental legislation. But Baker   s great contributions to the country were recognized  in 1984 he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the United States. The Art of Diplomacy Like Watergate, the Iran-Contra scandal greatly damaged the public   s trust in the government, as well as Congress   s faith in the White House. When he assumed the position of chief of staff in 1987, Baker was facing a tense situation similar to the one he had weathered nearly fifteen years earlier. But he recalled that the president   s decision to hire him was largely based on his ability to get along with other lawmakers.    I was well received. I suppose it signaled a new era. I believe that the relationship between Congress   especially the Senate   and the White House was significantly different, even after the year and a half I was there, from what it was in the beginning. There was an element of bipartisanship that I   d been involved with for years, because as Republican leader, or as minority leader for that matter, you   ve got to sort of bridge that chasm between the two sides. That bipartisan approach   seemed to go down well in the White House. The president, by the way, welcomed that,    Baker said. Baker worked with Congress to further Reagan   s initiatives, but he did not automatically follow the president   s position on every issue. He disagreed with other White House and cabinet officials on the pullout of US warships from the Persian Gulf, and he voiced concerns about the administration   s decision to nominate Judge Douglas Ginsburg to the Supreme Court. But in 1988 Baker left his position in order to care for his wife, who later died of cancer. In 1996 Baker married former Kansas Senator Nancy Kassebaum. In 2001, more than a decade after he left the White House, Baker returned to government service as US Ambassador to Japan. In the wake of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Baker worked to strengthen diplomatic ties between the United States and its closest Pacific ally. Civility for Future Generations In later years, Baker   s thoughts turned to future generations and how they could continue the spirit of cooperation and civic duty that marked his political career. Baker founded the Howard H. Baker Jr. Center for Public Policy in 2003. The center is devoted to supporting scholarship and fostering dialogue on topics pertaining to current events, governance, policy, and citizenship. It sponsors lectures, classes, workshops, research, and student initiatives related to policy and politics, particularly in the areas of global security, leadership and governance, and energy and the environment. The center also houses the papers of many Tennessee politicians from the past century, including Baker, Kefauver, Senator Fred Thompson, Representative Harold Ford Jr., and Representative John J. Duncan. In 2005, Vice President Dick Cheney was present for the groundbreaking of the Baker Center building. On October 31, 2008, Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O   Connor attended the dedication of the center   s stately facilities at 1640 Cumberland Avenue. One of the final Baker Center events the senator attended was veteran journalist Tom Brokaw   s visit to campus on November 13, 2013   coinciding with Baker   s eighty-eighth birthday two days later.    I   m very proud to be associated with the Baker Center in a political environment that today is in many ways controversial and uncivil. I   m proud of raising the bar in debates and calling upon others to rise to the occasion. We can always disagree but still recognize the need for bipartisan solutions. These attitudes of mine have been sharpened since coming to the center. With everything we do here, the theme is always about Senator Baker and his legacy. I hope that is something that defines the Baker Center uniquely in the years and decades ahead,    Murray said. Baker is survived by his wife  a son, Darek Baker of Brentwood, Tennessee  a daughter, Cynthia    Cissy    Baker of McLean, Virginia  two sisters  and four grandchildren.","link":"http:\/\/bakercenter.utk.edu\/howard-baker-legacy\/"},{"title":"Reports","content":"Reports ","link":"http:\/\/bakercenter.utk.edu\/reports\/"},{"title":"Publications","content":"Publications Click here for a full list of publications.","link":"http:\/\/bakercenter.utk.edu\/publications-2\/"},{"title":"Protected: Economics 570","content":"Protected  Economics 570 This content is password protected.

Harrison reports on his research efforts to his supervisor and mentor, Dr. Krista Wiegand, Baker Faculty Fellow in Global Security.   Research Activities He  has been working on completing a first draft of my paper with early statistical analysis examining the impact of elite capture on terrorism from minority ethnic groups. As he was developing the paper over the semester, its theory and model were greatly helped by being able to engage with other graduate research fellows, particularly Aaron Gold who recommended readings and data sources measurements to use for his  model. He has also begun work on a project with Mehdi Ayari examining, within the Muslim world, the outcome of elections when there are multiple religious political parties as opposed to only one religious party participating in the election. This project will examine whether having multiple religious parties spoils the chances of any of them having significant electoral victories. He is also continuing to read the terrorism foreign policy literature and work on his  initial research design for his dissertation idea--examining the impact of US foreign policy and  the War on Terror on foreign governments  policies towards terrorism within their borders and the resulting increase in domestic terrorism. In regards to his  cross field concentration (CFC) in public policy, he has  begun to develop the policy section of this project as the idea for his  CFC paper, examining how US policies to combat terrorism are  used as policy signaling to other states. To this end, he has  written an early draft laying out ideas for the theory and beginning to place it within the relevant literature.

His research focuses on the management of contentious issues with regards to three types of conflict processes. The first, interstate conflict, investigates the relationship between territory and armed conflict, the benefits of resolving contentious issues, and how non-territorial issues are managed. The second, terrorism, investigates the relationship between domestic and transnational terrorism, and factors such as regime type, economic development, and minority discrimination. The third, civil war, investigates how third party mediator bias and leverage lead to successful mediation in civil wars. His work has appeared in  Conflict Management and Peace Science.

The project has noted important links between rebel movements and piracy attacks in the Sulu Sea and the Gulf of Guinea. Groups, such as Abu Sayyaf in the Southern Philippines and MEND in Niger Delta appear to use pirate attacks to raise revenue for their insurgencies. The project documents the relationships between governance voids, economic insecurity and the emergence of pirate gangs. Using satellite data on nightly emissions of light from several countries, Prins finds that pirates strategically locate in goldilocks littoral zones  areas that neither too well governed nor too anarchic. Such areas facilitate illicit markets and trading as well as allow for collusion between weak local officials and pirate leaders.

The gear included support equipment, rifles, fixed-wing aircraft, armored personnel carriers and grenade launchers.  caption id= attachment_13316  align= aligncenter  width= 588   Police wearing riot gear try to disperse a crowd Monday, Aug. 11, 2014, in Ferguson, Mo.

Given the nature of the gear and the visible imagery associated with its use, the authors were admittedly surprised by the findings. The authors have noted several caveats, including the possibility of abuse on the part of some agencies receiving the gear. Additional data and additional empirical scrutiny will be required before any definitive statements can be made regarding the 1033 Program and its consequences for local communities. The research  was referenced in U.S. Attorney General Sessions     speech to the Biennial Conference of the National Fraternal Order of Police in Nashville on August 28, 2017 and was immediately followed by the Trump administration announcing its recent policy change  and signing of Executive Order 13809, on  Restoring State, Tribal, and Local Law Enforcement s Access to Life-Saving Equipment and Resources.

Students will learn about current issues affecting their world and how they can impact society directly. The Baker Center will provide resources (examples, advice, etc.), a policy brief template and support throughout the semester. The HBGPC is based on the University of Pennsylvania   s Fels Institute Policy Challenge and has evolved since 2013. The Challenge requires an individual or team to tackle a real issue which can be addressed with a public policy solution or something that informs public policy (educational website, a training program, a mobile app, etc.). We will offer some problems gathered from local and state agencies, but students can find their own too.

It will be due on April 9, 2018. The video should support the policy and will be judged on content, not the technical merit of the video itself. Policy briefs should be direct and concise, about 5-9 pages, excluding appendix and references. The brief must include  Title Cover page Executive Summary   This section is for those who won   t likely read the entire brief.  Therefore, it must interest the reader and provide a synopsis of the main parts and findings. Introduction & Problem Statement-- Introduction, background, current policies, solution Policy Options--Alternative solutions working in other areas and your solution -justified Action Plan-- Timetable for implementation, stakeholders identified with roles, promotion &  marketing plan, evaluation plan, future continuous improvement process Budget and Funding Sources Needs   Resources needed for policy implementation and possible source Conclusion   Concise summary of proposal Appendix   Any supplemental information that is essential to the proposal References   Sources used to develop proposal All sources should be listed. The supporting arguments for a policy recommendation must communicate in a compelling manner -- why it is the best! For example, students must thoughtfully consider not only the substance of a specific policy, but also the socio-political influences, costs, stakeholders (direct and indirect, for and against), institutional processes, and decision-making structures, which are involved in approving, initiating and implementing the recommended policy. It is very important to consult those supporting the issue, against the issue, impacted by the problem, and those in power to implement your solution. Your project may also be a tool, such as a website, educational program, software or app that further addresses or informs an existing problem. Judging Criteria Is there a clear problem definition and significant issue? Is the solution doable and worth doing? Is there a solid implementation plan? Do they have a plan to measure success? Have they engaged the issue   s stakeholders? Was the team   s oral and written presentation persuasive and will they be effective?

I have written countless research papers during my time as an undergraduate student (and through internship experiences), but having to form an action plan, derive a budget and funding sources, think rigorously of potential impediments to policy implementation, and reach out to stakeholders and allies across a variety of disciplines allowed me to develop skills that, I believe, employers will place tremendous value on.   Regarding the allocation of my winnings, I intend to continue pushing forward with my policy, and adapting if and when necessary. I will be reaching out shortly to Dr. Buchanan (Director, Knox County Health Department), as well as Ms. Henley and Ms. Hudson (also from KCHD) to assess if and how we can integrate my policy proposal   s drug-awareness and health-education campaign into their public health offerings to mitigate opioid abuse and neonatal abstinence syndrome here in East Tennessee (e.g., through the Knox Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention Initiative, a k a KAPPI). I also intend to reach out to Ms. Burrows from the Governing Institute to discuss potentially running a piece related to my policy proposal through her institution.  Questions?

Congratulations to Professor Brotman and Professor Tonn! About Diplomacy Lab The University of Tennessee, through the Howard H. Baker Jr. Center for Public Policy, has been a partner in the U.S. Department of State   s Diplomacy Lab since fall 2015 semester. The program enables the Department of State to    course-source    research and innovation related to foreign policy by harnessing the efforts of students and faculty at universities across the country. Each semester, the Department of State sends out a list of proposed projects to participating universities. Currently, 28 universities participate in the program. Universities bid on specific project proposals. Guided by a faculty member with expertise in the area of interest, selected teams or classes get to explore real-world challenges, engage with State Department officials and produce a final product that accomplishes goals identified by the Department of State. It is a great opportunity for experiential learning and enables students to contribute to the policymaking process. To date, a total of eleven projects at UT have been selected to participate in the program since its inception.

In the November 2018 election, Smith was elected to the Campbell County School Board. Before attending the University of Tennessee, Noah attended high school in Campbell County. Now, as a 19 year old, Noah will serve as the youngest to be elected to the school board. His election also makes him the youngest person elected to municipal office in the state of Tennessee. When asked why he decided to run for this position, Noah stated,    The protection of public education is essential to securing the future of our nation and so getting involved at the local level is sometimes the most important   . Noah hopes that by getting involved at such a young age, he will bring a fresh and unique aspect to the school board, while also acquiring the knowledge and experience to further his future career. As a member of the school board, Noah hopes to increase the technology for rural Tennessee public schools. As a student at the University, Noah is pursuing a degree in Political Science and Economics, and hopes to one day obtain a PhD. In addition to being a Baker Ambassador, Noah is also a the Chairman of First Year Council, a member of CEB Issues Committee, SGA Government Affairs, and Chancellor   s Honors. Lauren Patterson, Baker Scholar, Global Leadership Scholar, and recent UT graduate, now working for Bank of America. Lauren Patterson, a recent graduate of the Haslam College of Business, Global Leadership Scholar, and Baker Scholar is enjoying post graduate success as she begins working full time at the Bank of America headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina. Lauren majored in Economics with a collateral in International Business and a minor in Public Policy Analytics through the Baker Center. Growing up in Williamson County, TN, where both her parents were state employees, she    learned from an early age the importance of policy and the potential impacts of policy changes.    She further developed this interest in college through internships with a member of British Parliament and Bank of America Merrill Lynch. These experiences    reinforced my interests in the ability of the government and business to work together to make this world better.    As a Baker Scholar, Lauren decided to dive in health policy after a summer with Bank of America, where she    worked with the healthcare team that analyzes and underwrites loans for large healthcare corporations.    In her thesis research, which can be found here, Lauren examined    how the number of plans offered and firms in a set market, plan pricing components, and country health variables impact monthly premium pricing for plans sold on the individual market.    The creation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which required private insurers to insure everyone who applied, charge the same premiums to people of the same age, and cover pre-existing conditions, ultimately aimed to increase the insured rate. However, some of the ACA regulations led to    heterogeneous risk pools   , meaning that people paid equal premiums regardless of their risk. Lauren observed that when risk pools are not separated,    the premium for that pool will rise over time due to the high-risk payers making significantly more costly claims.    Due to the increasing premiums, healthy enrollees, exited the market. Additionally, as more regulations on insurance companies were created, many private firms pulled out of ACA insurance exchanges, which left some markets with only one insurer. In Lauren   s research, she also analyzed how consolidation of insurers or low competition affects premium costs. Lauren used an ordinary least squares regression to analyze the relationship between premium prices and the number of plans sold while accounting for    country health variables and other insurance plan pricing components.    Through her research, Lauren found that a maximum out of pocket price, the rate of excess drinking, and the unemployment rate had the largest effect on premium price. Additionally, she found that    more plans in a market are associated with lower premium prices,    which supports other research in the field. For Lauren, the most interesting finding was how risk pools and the theory of competition with price interact. She found that premium costs weren   t only impacted by the number of plans available or the number of firms in a market, because the two interact to create price changes in the market. The Baker Scholars program and project helped Lauren see what interested her in the realm of public policy. While Lauren was always interested in health and healthcare policy, she sees it    more as a calling than an interest    now. After a few years working as a full-time analyst with the Bank of America, Lauren may consider pursuing a doctorate degree in Economics. Grace Malone, Baker Ambassador and Scholar, Global Leadership Scholar, and a student in the Chancellor s Honors College, FBI Summer Intern Grace Malone is a rising senior majoring in Public Administration with a collateral in International Business and a double minor in Public Policy Analytics and Spanish. This summer, Grace will be participating in the honors internship program with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), a 10-week paid internship. Grace will also continue working part time throughout the school year in order to maintain her top-secret security clearance. Although she had the option of working at the FBI headquarters in Quantico, Virginia or a variety of field offices, Grace chose to work at the Knoxville office    to stay close to home and learn more about the crime that happens in our own backyard.    With her assignment as an intern intelligence analyst, Grace works under special agents within the many divisions of the FBI to help with leads or active cases. Grace has always    had a passion for justice, whether it be criminal, social, or otherwise.    Previously, Grace has worked with a variety of non-profits, including the Africa Education and Leadership Initiative, Help Musicians UK, and the Alliance for Better Nonprofits in Knoxville in order to learn more about the altruistic side of social justice. The internship with the FBI interested Grace because it provided the perfect opportunity to learn about other aspects of justice, specifically criminal justice. After graduation in the spring, Grace hopes to pursue a law degree. She feels lucky to have this opportunity because    It is definitely something not many people can say that they have had the opportunity to do, and having an intimate look at the inner works of the justice department will be invaluable to me.    For other students interested in criminal justice and seeking an internship with the FBI, Grace warns that the application process is lengthy with a deadline that comes very quickly, so it is necessary to begin planning early. Greta Roberts, Baker Ambassador, participating in the University of Tennessee Congressional Internship Program Greta Roberts is a rising senior double majoring in political science and history, with a minor in Arab studies. Throughout the school year, Greta serves as a Baker Ambassador. Although Greta just returned from a spring semester in Morocco, she is already onto the next challenge. This summer, Greta is spending three months on Capitol Hill as a part of the University of Tennessee Congressional Internship Program. She will spend the first session with Congressman Jim Cooper (5th district of TN) and the second session with Congressman David Kustoff (8th district of TN). Greta has many different tasks, which vary by day. Each week, she is paired with a staffer and she attends    briefings and hearings on their behalf, then write reports and memos for them.    She also attends daily meetings with Congressman Cooper, where she has the opportunity to present news articles and receive feedback. Another vital part of her job concerns constituent services, such as answering phone calls and giving tours. Finally, as an intern, Greta is able to attend various events off the Hill. She recently saw Bernie Sanders speaking at the Washington Post. Every day in Congress is excited, but the most interesting thing Greta has done so far is attend a hearing for the House Foreign Relations Committee, which focused on the future of the Middle East and North Africa. She had the opportunity to    see how a full hearing is run and to hear more about what policy plans the Trump Administration has for these two key strategic regions.    Greta decided to apply for this program because she    wanted the opportunity to live in D.C. for the summer and to see if it   s somewhere I would want to live in the future.    As a political science major, Greta knew that there was no better place to see politics in action than Congress. More information on this program and how to apply can be found here. After graduation, Greta is considering applying for a Fulbright Scholarship to conduct research and study Arabic in Morocco. Baker Scholar Awarded Fulbright Scholarship Avanti Rangnekar, an Economics major, Public Policy Analytics minor, and Baker Scholar, has received a Fulbright U.S. Student Program award to India in health economics from the U.S. Department of State and the J. William Fulbright Foreign Scholarship Board. Rangnekar will conduct research in Karnataka as part of a project to examine the demand for informal healthcare providers in India. Rangnekar is one of over 1,900 U.S. citizens who will conduct research, teach English, and provide expertise abroad for the 2018-2019 academic year through the Fulbright U.S. Student Program. Recipients of Fulbright awards are selected on the basis of academic and professional achievement as well as record of service and leadership potential in their respective fields. This year, the University of Tennessee had 18 Fulbright recipients, breaking a school record. The Fulbright Program is the flagship international educational exchange program sponsored by the U.S. government and is designed to build lasting connections between the people of the United States and the people of other countries. The Fulbright Program is funded through an annual appropriation made by the U.S. Congress to the U.S. Department of State   s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs. Participating governments and host institutions, corporations, and foundations around the world also provide direct and indirect support to the Program, which operates in over 160 countries worldwide. When asked what it means to have received this scholarship, Rangnekar claims,    Receiving the Fulbright-Nehru grant means everything to my family and I. The grant not only gives me the ability to experience firsthand the rapidly evolving Indian healthcare system, but it also gives me the opportunity to immerse myself in the culture that contributes significantly to my identity as a South Asian American. I am most excited that I get to combine my interests in medicine and economics through my research, but also learn more about my heritage by living and working in India.    Rangnekar is a Baker Scholar and will be graduating the the first class of the Public Policy Analytics Minor, housed in the Baker Center. Additionally, Dr. Katie Cahill, Associate Director of the Baker Center, is one of her thesis advisors and is working with her to secure a second affiliation at an academic institution in New Delhi.    I could never have achieved what I have without the community and support that I received from the Baker Scholars Program, Haslam Scholars Program, Economics Department, and Office of National Scholarships and Fellowships. It s a support system that I will forever be grateful for and that I will certainly be visiting whenever I come back to visit Rocky Top!    Gabriella LaRose, Baker Ambassador and Scholar, Presents Research at Chicago Conference Gabriella LaRose, a junior at the University of Tennessee, will be presenting research at the Midwest Political Science Association (MPSA) Conference in Chicago, IL. LaRose is a philosophy major with a concentration in law and politics and a minor in political science. She has been actively involved with the Baker Center since her freshman year when she was a member of the Baker Center   s Living and Learning Community. She now serves as a Baker Ambassador and a Baker Scholar. LaRose   s research titled,    Refugees and Terrorism  An Empirical Analysis of Refugee Flows and Domestic and Suicide Terrorism    examines the relationship between incoming refugee flows and domestic and suicide terrorism. She finds that incoming refugees neither increased nor decreased the number of domestic or suicide terrorist incidents. When asked why this research is important, LaRose says,    In light of rhetoric by President Trump and other government representatives, we sought to show evidence that refugees are not dangerous in the way they are portrayed to be. Also, with the Syrian Refugee crisis and mass exodus of refugees from Africa, it is important to let populations know that refugees are seeking shelter, not seeking a platform for terrorist action.    LaRose is a co-author with Dr. Sambuddah Ghatak and Dr. Hement Sharma. After the research was submitted and accepted for the conference, Dr. Ghatak asked LaRose to present to give her more experience in a professional setting. The research has also given her the chance to learn new research techniques, like coding and modeling. She says she had never used this kind of research before and, while it was challenging, she found the importance of becoming familiar with these research techniques. She hopes that speaking at MPSA will improve her presentation skills and allow her to become more comfortable with presenting other research projects she has worked on. Gabriella gives credit to the Baker Center for the opportunities it has presented her with.    Since I was a freshman, staff and older students at the Baker Center have encouraged me to ask for what I want, take advantage of every opportunity, and be grateful to those who helped me along the way. I really wouldn t be presenting without the support they ve given me over the years.    Jacob Hayes, MPPA Student and US State Department Summer Intern I am a second-year law student at the University of Tennessee Knoxville Law School and I spent my summer being an intern for the US Department of State. The US State Department places an emphasis on both national and international diplomacy. Employees at the US State Department are to be exemplars of American diplomacy, representing and advocating US interests on an international level. My summer in Washington, D.C. working for the U.S. Department of State was the culmination of a year-long application process involving multiple interviews and conversations with Department officials. Upon being granted security clearance, I served in the Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation within the office of Weapons of Mass Destruction Terrorism.  I had the chance to work with some of the best experts in the U.S. government who were all dedicated public servants. They taught me so much about diplomacy and the foreign policy process.  Everyday, I learned something new about working within the administrative state and gained new tools for making myself competitive for the job market. Living in Washington D.C. and experiencing its energy and diversity reinforced my ambition of working there after graduation. My passion for international politics and policy formation grew even stronger after hours of conversation with the people working there, and my preconceived notions about federal bureaucracy were dispelled.  I am so grateful for the support of the Howard Baker Jr. Center faculty who made my experience possible.  Lucy Greer, Baker Ambassador, Baker Scholar, and Boren Scholar in Jordan Lucy Greer is a senior at the University of Tennessee Knoxville majoring in political science with a concentration in international affairs. She has received a prestigious Boren Scholarship that has allowed her to spend this year studying Arabic and researching international politics in Jordan. The Boren Scholarship is an initiative of the National Security Education Program. The program provides funding opportunities for US undergraduate students to study less frequently taught languages in regions vital to US interests such as Africa, Asia, Central and Eastern Europe, Eurasia, Latin America, and the Middle East. Because of her avid interest in history and Arabic studies, Lucy always knew she wanted to pursue a career in diplomacy and international affairs. She has wanted to apply for the Boren Scholarship since her freshman year of college, as the program stresses both national security and government service. The language aspect additionally contributed to her decision, because the program would give her an opportunity to practice speaking Arabic daily. When asked why she wanted to go to Jordan, Lucy cited the two foremost places she wanted to study abroad  Morocco and Jordan. Her main interest lies in the Middle Eastern region called Levant. This region includes Jordan, Iraq, Syria, Palestine, and Lebanon. As for her research, Lucy is working on her Baker Scholar thesis while abroad in Jordan. While there she plans to examine American support for the moderate Syrian opposition in the Syrian Civil War under US President Barack Obama and its relationship to the war in Iraq. When asked what sparked her interest in this research topic, Lucy responded,    A lot of the discourse coming out of the Iraq War was the United States should not have invaded, yet in the case of Syria many argued that we should have done more. That contrast really fascinates me.    She said that the most difficult part of her research process has been her research of Syria. Much of the information coming out of Syria is incomplete, and the fracturing of different forces within Syria makes the information that does exist difficult to fully trust and rely upon. When asked what the most important thing she has learned so far in Jordan is she advises,    Don   t be afraid to speak in Arabic at the grocery store because even though you sound like an idiot at least you   re getting some practice.       Don   t be afraid to speak in Arabic at the grocery store because even though you sound like an idiot at least you   re getting some practice.    Lucy has most enjoyed the opportunity to speak Arabic in the context of her everyday life while in Jordan. She believes it shows her that all her hard work in her Arabic studies has paid off. Furthermore, she states that she has had the opportunity to meet many incredible people during her time thus far. Lucy is loving her experience abroad, as she advises,    if you can go abroad at all, even only for a week or two, definitely seize that opportunity.       If you can go abroad at all, even only for a week or two, definitely seize that opportunity.    When asked what she would say to others who are pursuing research, Lucy advises,    Find a policy area that is so massively interesting you ll never get tired of it. What I love about all the Baker Scholars is their individual passions for specific areas of policy, they live their passion from the inside out.    Nathan Timbs, Baker Ambassador and Intern for Senator Bob Corker I am a junior studying political science with a concentration in international affairs. I am also a religious studies major with a minor in Arabic studies. I have always had an interest in international politics  disputes  and government types, with a focus in the Middle Eastern region. I was fortunate to serve as an intern in Senator Bob Corker   s Knoxville office over the summer. His position as Chair of the Foreign Relations Committee only increased my interest in international politics. My dream career is to work for the U.S. State Department in Washington, DC, or abroad in an embassy. This career choice is fueled by my love of international relations but also by a strong desire to impact the world in a beneficial way. What was your first day like? Your last day? I did not know what to expect on my first day, but I was given a packet of Senator Corker s statements and stances on hot button issues currently being debated including health care, Syria, and Cuba. I was then trained on how to answer constituents    questions, which could be categorized under one of two groupings  comments and casework.  Once I began answering calls, I felt like I was finally a part of government and making a difference. Being able to finally make an impact felt amazing, and I could not wait to help people on a daily basis.  My last day was a fitting end to my time as an intern for Senator Corker. The night before I stayed up to watch the final health care reform vote on CSPAN. It failed 49-51, and with that vote, the weeks of comments and concerns from constituents concluded in an end result. I was able to fully witness government work right in front of me as local feedback and debates on Capitol Hill culminated into a vote that will impact the nation for years to come. I was saddened to know that I was having to leave behind unfinished casework, as I could np longer help constituents with their needs. Overall, this internship strengthened my appreciation for government because I was able to see it work efficiently and effectively from a perspective I had never before witnessed. What was the most important thing you learned during your internship? I learned two very important things during my internship. The first was to be calm and professional in every situation. Answering phone calls from angry constituents sometimes tested my patience, since not everyone follows the golden rule of    treat others as you would wish to be treated,    but I always reminded myself that I was first and foremost a representative of Senator Corker. Secondly, I learned the importance of making a good impression on those around me whether it be a coworker, a boss, or a constituent. Presentation of self was critical in my position, and I realized that this internship would have consequences for my future.  I learned that working hard, going above what I was being asked, and trying to always be professional would serve me well in the future.  What was the most surprising moment? The most surprising moment, and also a very exciting moment, was when I saw all of our work on our    Joint Operation    veterans event come to fruition. The weeks of work that I had done assisting the planning and execution of this event resulted in a resounding success in which over 500 veterans were able to receive assistance for various needs and issues. Since I had never helped plan an event of this scale, I was amazed at how well our office had executed this event. Seeing the work that I did directly impact constituents made all of the effort more than worth it.  I was surprised that government could work so effectively to meet specific needs, rather than the disaster that is presented by the media on a daily basis. Being on the inside of government will make anyone truly appreciate the meaningful work being done.  How did the experience impact your future plans? My experience reinforced my love for government and public policy, but I did not expect the largest benefit I received. Through my internship I came to the realization that I have an intense passion for helping others and that I want to do that on an international scale. This experience also inspired me to apply for an internship next summer with Senator Corker and the Foreign Relations Committee. Without the knowledge gained from this internship and connections I have made, this process would have been much harder, if not impossible. What will you always remember? During my internship, I was fortunate enough to serve as the representative for Senator Corker at a naturalization ceremony. For those who do not know, a naturalization ceremony is the legal proceeding individuals go through to officially become U.S. citizens. The moment 30 individuals from 20 nationalities became U.S. citizens is one I will never forget, as they all had expressions of happiness and achievement.  This made me realize how important government is and how great it can be.

Roadway quality is now at risk unless new funding is found. That s the finding reported in a new paper produced by researchers at the Howard H. Baker Jr. Center for Public Policy at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.  The  policy brief is available here    PolicyBrief-4-15-Gas.11.24.15 UT Baker Center researchers, Dr. Mark Burton, Dr. David Greene and Dr. Matt Murray, collaborated to recommend a policy for maintaining and improving roads in light of declining gas tax revenues.   The decline in revenue is mainly due to inflation (gas tax has not been increased since  1989 when gas cost around $1 gallon)  and the  improving gas efficiency of cars.   The authors recommend a combination of raising the tax and indexing it to inflation and efficiency.","link":"http:\/\/bakercenter.utk.edu\/future-of-roadway-funding-in-tennessee-policy-brief-nov-24-2015\/"},{"title":"How much should hybrids and electric vehicles contribute to roadway funding?

Those values are at the heart of the Baker Studies Program   s mission, which is essentially twofold. First, the Baker Studies Program encourages and facilitates the maximum use of the Modern Political Archives housed at the Baker Center. These archives, which include the papers of Senator Baker and many of Tennessee   s most accomplished modern political leaders and jurists, are a significant and substantial resource for scholars, journalists, students, and others interested in regional and national history. The archives    Oral History Program, for instance, includes the transcripts of some 300 interviews of Senator Baker and numerous of his associates. Second, the Baker Studies Program provides a unique forum for exploring the values that Senator Baker epitomized in his career in public service. Hopefully, public policy decision makers will be inspired by that career and will espouse those values that were Senator Baker   s hallmark. Toward that end, the Baker Studies Program is sponsoring academic conferences on topics ranging from Senator Baker   s role in the Senate Watergate Committee   s investigation to the service rendered by Senator Baker as Senate minority and majority leader, President Richard Nixon   s overtures to Senator Baker as a possible successor to U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Marshall Harlan, and Senator Baker   s tenure as White House Chief of Staff to President Ronald Reagan. The director of the Baker Studies Program is Theodore Brown Jr., a University of Tennessee alumnus and a Vanderbilt Law School graduate who practiced law in Atlanta for 25 years before returning to Knoxville to begin his teaching career. Brown is a lecturer in the University of Tennessee   s Department of Political Science, where he teaches constitutional law, judicial process, and law in American society. He is also an adjunct professor of law in American legal history at the university   s College of Law. Brown is co-editor of Legal Papers of Andrew Jackson, published by the University of Tennessee Press, and is working on a book about the late Senator Estes Kefauver.

With the help of Pyxl, Inc., a local integrated marketing firm, and the Knox County Election Commission, the Baker Center was able to create a website that housed an  online-based training system that trained 295 individuals. Campus coordinators on each of the three campuses visited classrooms, attended job fairs, recruited students at various campus events, hung flyers, sent out email blasts, and worked in conjunction with major campus organizations to spread the word about Work the Polls.   Students were asked to watch three short online training videos, pass a test, and complete their training by attending an in-person review session at the Baker Center in October. Since that time, a midterm election has transpired, in which 133 college students were placed as poll workers throughout the 94 polling locations in Knox County.   The Knox County Election Commission reported that this election cycle was the first in nearly 15 years that there was no shortage of election workers!   A remarkable number of students reported having positive experiences as election officials and with other election officials at their polling place, with nearly 95% of respondents reporting that they would participate as poll workers again in the future.   Feedback from participants was overwhelmingly positive.    I gained a wealth of information about voting policy and procedure, had the opportunity to work with people who were supportive and genuinely delightful, and got to serve the community and support a privilege (the right to vote) in which I strongly believe.       I really enjoyed helping my community and learning about our democratic processes.   Working the polls made me understand how directly voting impacts my own community.       I assisted several young voters voting for the very first time and that made the day worthwhile.   I met and made friends with my fellow poll workers, who were very kind and helpful.   They said I did an excellent job and was very thorough and efficient.   I enjoyed this experience, especially returning the voting machines to the City County Building.   I didn   t realize the security and manpower it requires to ensure all ballots are cast and accurately counted.       I enjoyed seeing my friends and neighbors coming to vote.   It made me feel as if I were doing something patriotic and was proud to be seen at the polling station.  Work the Polls is representative of the Baker Center   s mission to promote civic engagement, especially among young adults, whom Senator Baker calls    trustees of this grand tradition and legacy of freedom, of opportunity   .   Senator Baker goes on to urge that    our young people, who are easily the best educated, most aware, and the most participatory of any generation, involve themselves in the politics of their country.    Work the Polls is part of a three-year grant that will recruit and train college students through the 2012 presidential election.

This is the central question that participants will grapple with in an up-coming workshop at the Baker Center for Public Policy on the future of governance. People around the world are disillusioned with government. In the United States, voting rates are down and the approval ratings of the major parties are near historic lows. At the federal level, good governance is hindered by numerous factors, including  extreme partisanship, unabashed lobbying, and a lack of financial resources to explore novel program ideas. Law makers spend an inordinate amount of time raising campaign funds. Many end up voting on complicated legislation that they do not have time to read. And the world is getting more complex. At the birth of the union, the population of the United States numbered in the low millions. Now, the population has topped 300 million. The world   s population now exceeds 6 billion. There are almost 200 countries in the United Nations. American society alone is composed of millions of businesses and non-profit organizations and thousands of local governments and special districts. The problems facing the country are multiplying in number. Their roots are complex and most overlap and inter-relate with other problems. The problems cover the gamut from preventing WMDs to increasing high school graduation rates, from reducing emissions of greenhouse gases to keeping Social Security solvent. Due to various factors, including dogmatic partisanship, law makers rarely explore many solutions to any one or combination of problems. Given time pressures on law makers, the complexity of the issues they must address, and the constrained number and types of solutions to problems they assess, it is highly unlikely that decisions made by our law makers are anywhere near optimal, to be judicious. How can rationality in public policy be increased? One potential answer to this question is to increase our reliance on computers. Computers are already ubiquitous throughout society, think PCs, cell phones, iPods, and digital TV. Computer chips are embedded in cars, microwave ovens, and thermometers. In the background, software approves credit card purchases and even the offering of credit. More visibly, word processing, spreadsheet, and presentation software are everyday tools in the workplace and school. Computers and software are also currently assisting government in many ways. Numerous computer models provide inputs to law makers and government bureaucrats. These models include those that forecast economic growth, gasoline prices, and inflation. Computer models are also important in helping everyone understand global climate change, the incidence of forest fires, traffic congestion, home energy use, local air and water pollution, and the transmission of disease. Spreadsheet models help policy analysts structure decisions and organize information to help them make policy decisions. For problems that have many possible solutions, software built around sophisticated search algorithms can sort through thousands, tens of thousands, even billions of potential solutions to find the optimal solution or at least some very good ones. Law makers do not rely on software directly as they shape public policy. However, tt can be imagined that software could help law makers organize their public policy decision making processes and choices under consideration. Powerful models could be made available to simulate potential future worlds under various policy regimes. Policy makers could interact with the software to indicate the characteristics of potential future worlds that they value and those that they do not. The software could search for solutions to policy problems that are most preferable. Then, law makers could negotiate compromises amongst themselves, starting from many different but preferred policy alternatives. Workshop participants will be asked to push beyond what could be considered near-term thinking. Why not take this line of thought about computers and governance even further? Why not have a computer system elicit values from all the law makers and then find the public policy solution that best satisfies all the law makers, under the assumption that old fashion bargaining will not produce close to optimal results? Then, the law makers could vote up or down on the solution proposed by the computer. Why not have a computer system elicit values from all the voters and then find the best solution amongst many billion potential solutions? Why not have a law that requires the output from the computer system to become law, under the assumption that political processes can not be trusted to make decisions in the public interest?","link":"http:\/\/bakercenter.utk.edu\/can-we-govern-ourselves-better\/"},{"title":"Baker Center and WBIR-TV to Host Gubernatorial Debate","content":"Baker Center and WBIR-TV to Host Gubernatorial Debate The University of Tennessee, Knoxville   s Howard H.

That question will be at the heart of a one-day Primary Care Nursing Summit to be held tomorrow (Thursday, Nov. 4), at the Belmont University Curb Center in Nashville. The summit is being sponsored by the Howard H. Baker Jr. Center for Public Policy at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. The Baker Center was assisted in planning the summit by faculty from the colleges of nursing at UT Knoxville and UT Health Sciences Center, the College of Medicine at the UT Health Sciences Center and Belmont University. The keynote speaker at the summit will be Susan Hassmiller of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, who is involved on the Initiative on the Future of Nursing at the Institute of Medicine. The Institute recently released a report entitled  The Future of Nursing  Leading Change, Advancing Health.  Other speakers will include Dr. Paul Erwin, director of UT Knoxville s Center for Public Health, who will outline the specific health care challenges that Tennessee faces, and Peter Buerhaus of the Center for Interdisciplinary Health Workforce Studies at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, who will look at cost and utilization data for advanced practice nurses treating Medicare beneficiaries. Following the morning presentations, small groups will be convened to discuss how to maximize the contributions of nurses in the delivery of primary health care services to improve the health of Tennesseans. The goal is to develop Tennessee-specific actionable recommendations.  Although opportunities abound, Tennessee and other states are faced with deep-rooted challenges related to our ability to respond to the reforms associated with the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,  said summit chairwoman, Carole Myers, an assistant professor in UT s College of Nursing and the Baker Center s fellow for health policy.  Those challenges include inadequate infrastructure and scarce resources and competing priorities.  Additionally, we struggle with a shortage of primary care providers, and this gap will be severely exacerbated when an estimated 30 million Americans, including 650,000 Tennesseans, will acquire health care coverage in 2014 under the new health care reform law. It is imperative that we be forward-thinking in Tennessee in determining priorities for addressing these challenges to assure the health of all Tennesseans and subsequently the vitality of the state.  About 80 health care professionals, educators and care providers are expected to attend the summit.   A live webcast of key note addresses will be available via the Baker Center web page.

Although opportunities abound, we are faced with deep-rooted challenges related to our ability to afford the reforms, inadequate infrastructure and scarce resources, sometimes paralyzing partisanship, and competing priorities.   Financial concerns, inadequate infrastructure and appropriate resources to effectively support health and health care, and a sickness orientation are particularly acute problems in Tennessee, a state ranked 44th in the annual assessment of the nation on a state-by-state basis.   Our health and health care challenges are related to a myriad of other issues, including the needs of aging baby boomers, our increasingly diverse population, and those afflicted with chronic diseases which are increasing in prevalence and emerging at ever-younger ages.   Additionally, we struggle with a shortage of primary care providers and this gap will be severely exacerbated when an estimated 30 million Americans, including 650,000 Tennesseans, will acquire health care coverage in 2014 under the the new health care reform law. It is imperative that we be forward-thinking in Tennessee in determining priorities for addressing these challenges to assure the health of all Tennesseans and subsequently the vitality of the state. Nurses could be a piece in the puzzle.   For example what new or expanded roles can nursing professionals assume to meet the needs of a team-based, coordinated, patient-centered health care delivery system?     What measures are required to meet the needs for more a larger, more diverse and more accessible nursing workforce now and in the future?   What are the most important changes required in the education and training of the nursing workforce of tomorrow? How can the nursing profession promote build upon community-based personnel and resources to help meet the needs for health literacy, prevention and primary care?   How can the nursing profession have a greater impact of policy affecting integrated health planning, funding and the social determinants of health?     How can technology and integration across the spectrum of medical and allied health fields enhance the effectiveness of nursing? Many of these questions will be considered at the one-day invitational Primary Care Nursing Summit sponsored by the Howard H. Baker Jr. Center for Public Policy on November 4, 2010 in Nashville, TN.   The Nursing Summit is scheduled in coordination with the release of the Institute of Medicine   s upcoming report The Future of Nursing. Dr. Susan Hassmiller from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation who is spearheading efforts for this initiative will deliver a keynote address at the Summit.

Baker   s will take place November 16-17 in the Baker Center   s Toyota Auditorium.   The conference, entitled Howard H. Baker, Jr.  A Life in Public Service, brings together noted scholars and journalists from around the country to discuss the impact that Senator Baker continues to have on public life.   This exciting event is the first of many we hope to produce from the work of the Baker Studies Program and the Modern Political Archives. The Baker Studies Program provides a unique forum for exploring the values that Senator Baker epitomized in his career in public service. It is hoped that public policy decision makers will be inspired by that career and will espouse those values that were Senator Baker   s hallmark.   The Baker Studies Program also encourages and facilitates the maximum use of the Modern Political Archives housed at the Baker Center. These archives, which include the papers of Senator Baker and many of Tennessee   s most accomplished modern political leaders and jurists, are a significant and substantial resource for scholars, journalists, students, and others interested in regional and national history. For instance, the archives    Oral History Program includes the transcripts of some 300 interviews Toward that end, this conference will explore topics ranging from Senator Baker   s role in the Senate Watergate Committee   s investigation to the service rendered by Senator Baker as Senate minority and majority leader, President Richard Nixon   s overtures to Senator Baker as a possible successor to U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Marshall Harlan, and Senator Baker   s tenure as White House Chief of Staff to President Ronald Reagan. The conference is free and open to the public and will be available to view via webcast.   During the conference items from our Modern Political Archives illustrating Howard H. Baker, Jr.   s career will be on display.       Proceedings of papers and panel discussion will be published in a forthcoming number of the Baker Center Journal of Applied Public Policy.

The Howard H. Baker Jr. Center for Public Policy is pleased to sponsor the University of Tennessee   s delegation in 2010 and has been assisting students involved with the Appellate Moot Court Collegiate Challenge (AMC3) in preparing for competition. Using the chambers of the Tennessee General Assembly, TISL consists of a Senate and House of Representatives. Each school has one Senator. The House has 99 members, which are apportioned according to enrollment. Garrett Montague will be serving as Senator from the University of Tennessee, while 15 other undergraduates will serve in the house and other roles as needed.   Montague, along with Brandon Whitely, is responsible for mobilizing the team to compete this year.    I was surprised to find there was not an organized effort to send a delegation from UT    Montague said.    Fortunately, there were several students on campus interested in reviving the group, including Brandon who is as passionate as I am about the program.   We   re all really excited about our chances in the elections this year.    The Appellate Moot Court program gives Tennessee undergraduates a chance to argue appellate cases with their peers. Five representatives will make up UT   s    legal team    of undergraduates to argue as petitioner and respondent about a legal problem before the Tennessee Intercollegiate Supreme Court presiding. AMC3 will be taking place concurrently with the General Assembly of TISL November 18-21.

Greene and Steven E. Plotkin Download this paper (pdf) Press Release Project Director  Judi Greenwald Project Manager  Nick Nigro Executive Summary  This report examines the prospects for substantially reducing the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the U.S. transportation sector, which accounts for 27 percent of the GHG emissions of the entire U.S. economy and 30 percent of the world   s transportation GHG emissions. Without shifts in existing policies, the U.S. transportation sector   s GHG emissions are expected to grow by about 10 percent by 2035, and will still account for a quarter of global transportation emissions at that time. If there is to be any hope that damages from climate change can be held to moderate levels, these trends must change. This report shows that through a combination of policies and improved technologies, these trends can be changed. It is possible to cut GHG emissions from the transportation sector cost-effectively by up to 65 percent below 2010 levels by 2050 by improving vehicle efficiency, shifting to less carbon intensive fuels, changing travel behavior, and operating more efficiently. A major co-benefit of reducing transportation   s GHG emissions is the resulting reductions in oil use and improvements in energy security. It develops three scenarios that diverge from    business as usual,    based on the assumption that the United States is willing to change the incentives and regulations that affect the design of vehicles, the types of fuels that are used, the choices made by individuals and businesses in purchasing and using vehicles, and how communities and their transportation infrastructure are built and used.

One in three children in this country is obese or overweight.18 The prevalence of childhood obesity has tripled over a 30-year period.17 In Knox County Tennessee, the prevalence of overweight or obese public school students increased from 38.3 percent in 2003 to 39.6 percent in 2008.12 Only one generation ago, type II diabetes in children was rare, but today it is common. Currently more than one-third of U.S. adults are obese.9 The prevalence of adult obesity increased rapidly from 1970-2000.11,12 In 2008, two-thirds of Knox County adults were overweight or obese.2 Obese individuals are at greater risk of asthma, diabetes, liver disease, orthopedic problems, and cardiovascular disease. A person   s risk of dying by age 50 is three-fold higher if obese, and even modest (10 to 20 pound) increases in body weight are associated with increased mortality rates.6 Approximately 10 percent of all medical costs are related to obesity. The rising cost of medical care is directly related to rising obesity rates. In 2008, obesity was responsible for direct medical expenditures of approximately $147 billion7, and this number is expected to grow. Obese beneficiaries cost Medicare over $600 per year more than normal weight individuals. Obesity has indirect financial costs as well. Work productivity is affected by the chronic illnesses related to obesity, such as sleep disorders and diabetes. Obesity causes greater rates of absenteeism, but up to 80% of loss in productivity may be in    presenteeism    wherein people show up for work but are unproductive compared to healthy workers. These costs of obesity to our society may even be higher than the direct medical costs. Obesity results from an interaction between genes and the environment. When individuals who are predisposed to weight gain are placed into certain environments, they will tend to develop obesity. Human genes have not changed that much over thousands of years, but an abundance of inexpensive, calorically dense foods beverages and a physical environment that restricts opportunities for physical activity has led to the obesity epidemic.14 Our current food supply contains many more calories than we need and the usual mechanisms governing satiety are overrun. Children   s eating and physical activity habits have changed over the past few decades. There has been a substantial increase in sugar-sweetened beverages, unhealthy snacks, and a high frequency of snacks and desserts.19 Children are also consuming inadequate amounts of healthy foods. In 2009, only 17.1 percent of Knox County High School students reported eating five or more fruits and vegetables per day over the past week.3 At the same time, children are becoming less active. The percentage of students walking or biking to school declined from 42% in 1969 to 13% in 2001.16 In addition, the percentage of high school students attending daily physical education classes declined from 42% in 1991 to 33% in 2009.7,15 In Knox County, 58.5 percent of high school students reported inadequate or no physical activity in the past week.3 Prevention of weight gain is often difficult because many aspects of our society promote overeating. These include food and beverage advertising, easy access to fast foods, an abundance of sweetened beverages, and large portion sizes. A number of practices or policies in place currently contribute to the high rate of obesity. High schools use soft drink revenues to fund their programs. Thus, school principles and other school administrators may perceive the sale of drinks as fiscally necessary. The presence of alternative unhealthy food choices is based on a similar logic, even though the school would receive more federal money if the approved lunch were consumed. The growth of sedentary jobs and our use of automobiles rather than walking or cycling for transportation have caused a decline in caloric expenditure.20 The way communities are built has a large impact on physical activity. A lack of street connectivity often precludes children and adults from walking and playing in adjacent subdivisions. Most areas lack safe biking and walking lanes along city streets and highways. Administratively, there is often a sense of disconnectedness between branches of government and a lack of continuity when administrations change. The political process is often fragmented, and the general public has an incomplete or poor understanding of the local planning process. There is a lack of longitudinal civic engagement that precludes fruitful dialogue. There are legal processes and the rights of businesses and landowners need to be considered. The general public may not recognize the need for environmental approaches to addressing the obesity epidemic, and may not be inclined to take advantage of changes when they are put in place. Thus, strong advocates are needed who will educate the public and push for implementing solutions to curb the obesity epidemic. The overall goal of this workshop was to better understand how we should encourage our communities to be healthier, in ways that will lower the rates of obesity and diabetes. The plan was to establish a dialogue between policy makers, public administrators, academic scholars, and concerned citizens. This was seen as an important step in the process of implementing policies that will impact the obesity epidemic.

Each day   s agenda was packed with exciting and unique opportunities for youth to learn about state government. The students toured the capitol and state museum, discussed proposed legislation that directly impacts education and studied the legislative process of passing a bill into law. Students also were given the chance to meet with representatives from their home districts. Representatives Steve Hall and Ryan Haynes and Senators Jamie Woodson and Stacey Campfield, visited with the students and answered questions about their concerns and experiences.

Baker Scholars include both graduate and undergraduate students from a wide cross-section of academic departments.     Each Baker Scholar must address public policy around one of the Center   s core areas of focus and or utilize the Modern Political Archives through a year-long research project.   Scholars are paired with faculty mentors who serve as resources and ultimately determine their project   s eligibility for course credit. UT   s Howard H. Baker Jr. Center for Public Policy is a nonpartisan institute devoted to education and scholarship concerning public policy and civic engagement. Through classes, public lectures, research, and outreach programs, the center aims to provide policy makers, citizens, scholars, and students with the information and skills necessary to work effectively within our political system and to serve our local, state, national, and global communities. ORNL is the U.S. Department of Energy   s largest multi-program science laboratory, with major efforts in energy security, global security, and basic research.

Despite the nuclear programs of rogue states Iran and North Korea, the threat of nuclear terrorism, increasing numbers of nuclear weapons in volatile or fragile parts of the world like Pakistan, or the nuclear disaster in Japan     the nuclear security agenda has receded in the national debate.   Global stockpiles of nuclear weapons, vulnerable nuclear material worldwide, and the byproducts of nuclear energy production will remain among the central challenges to US national security and global stability throughout the 21st century. Ambassador Linton Brooks will offer his perspectives on these important issues in a public lecture at the Baker Center.  Ambassador Brooks has over five decades of experience in national security, much of it associated with nuclear policy. While he currently is a senior advisor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a distinguished research fellow at the National Defense University, he previously served as the administrator of the US Department of Energy   s National Nuclear Security Administration and chief negotiator of the first Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, as well as in other key US government positions. Prior to his government service, he was a career Navy officer deployed on four nuclear-equipped ships. What role should nuclear weapons play in our national defense? Are nuclear weapons the most useful tool to combat today   s adversaries? In light of today   s budgetary constraints, how should the US spend its more limited resources on defense? What strategies can be employed to control rogue states with nuclear programs like Iran and North Korea? Do we have adequate security in place to prevent terrorists from acquiring nuclear weapons-usable material or technology? These are just some of the questions Ambassador Brooks will address as he examines how to best shape the US nuclear posture and policies in the 21st century.

Ambassador Bonnie Jenkins currently serves as the U.S. State Department   s Coordinator for the Threat Reduction Program in the Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation (ISN TR). She is the State Department lead on the upcoming Nuclear Security Summit in Seoul, South Korea.   Ambassador Jenkins coordinates State Department activities related to the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program and efforts to secure all vulnerable nuclear material. She is a noted expert on arms control and nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Ambassador Thomas Graham, Jr., is a former senior-level diplomat and an authority on nuclear nonproliferation. Ambassador Graham served as general counsel for the Department of State   s Arms Control and Disarmament Agency for fifteen years and was involved in the negotiation of every major arms control and nonproliferation agreement from 1970-1997. In addition, Ambassador Graham served as the Acting Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency in 1993 and from 1994-1997 served as the Special Representative of the President of the United States for Arms Control, Non-Proliferation and Disarmament, and in this capacity successfully led efforts to permanently extend the Non-Proliferation Treaty. This event is sponsored by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the Y-12 National Security Complex, Oak Ridge Associated Universities, the UT Student Chapter of the Institute of Nuclear Materials Management, and the Howard H. Baker Jr. Center for Public Policy. The event is free and open to the public.","link":"http:\/\/bakercenter.utk.edu\/nov-1-7-pm-global-security-arms-control-and-threat-reduction-a-discussion\/"},{"title":"Political Cartoonist, Marshall Ramsey, gives Baker Center a gift of drawings","content":"Political Cartoonist, Marshall Ramsey, gives Baker Center a gift of drawings Political cartoonist and UT Accomplished Alumnus, Marshall Ramsey, gave the Baker Center a gift of framed cartoons on a recent visit.

In total, he will have spent 16 months studying in the cities of Shanghai and Chengdu. RJ had the opportunity to travel to China for two semesters through the David Boren Scholarship Program, a national security scholarship sponsored by the Institute of International Education. RJ is spending his time in China not only with the purpose of understanding the Mandarin language, but also gaining a deep knowledge of Chinese culture.   He has carried many of his experiences from the Baker Center with him to China.    I had an opportunity to travel to rural Tibet for a few days in October. While there, I witnessed the manifestations of absolute poverty. While I was trying to get an idea of how deeply rooted these inequalities are, I drew on knowledge that I had gained while involved in the Baker Center.   After seeing how some of the most economically disadvantaged have few opportunities to better themselves, it refortified my desire to go into a career of public service.    At the culmination of his trip, RJ plans to share his experiences back home in Knoxville as well as integrate his trip into his Baker Scholar thesis project. He is currently conducting research on the rare-earth supply chain between China and the United States. As China and the US continue to forge the largest economic relationship in history, it is vitally important that they maintain good relations on key issues such as rare-earth trading. RJ is also learning first-hand culturally relevant phenomenon in Chinese culture, such as the concept of guanxi.    Guanxi is a sort of social dynamic and has to do with the relations that one has with a person or social network. The scope and importance that this has for the Chinese, in my experience, does not have an equivalent in the Western world.

The topic was  The Post-Fukushima World    Nuclear Energy Policy, Regulation and Markets after Fukushima Daiichi.   Each of the students returned with glowing reports of the forum and provided the short statements which follow  By Blake Palles Participating in the Howard Baker Forum in Washington, DC was truly an incredible experience.   Together with one hundred and sixty of the most important people in the nuclear industry, we discussed the industrial and political cooperation between the United States and Japan, specifically how that relationship would move forward in the wake of the recent Fukushima tragedy.   From our discussions, I found that the    post-Fukushima world    is likely to be a bright one. During my time there, I was struck by the presence of so many of the American and Japanese nuclear industry elite.   I was equally surprised at how approachable they were, and how eager they were to discuss their companies    role in the American Nuclear Renaissance, as well as their efforts abroad.   One of the people with whom I was able to speak was Yoshio Matsumi, Director of Japan   s ITOCHU Corporation.   He felt that referring to Japanese and American nuclear industries as separate entities was obsolete, owing to the extensive cooperation between the two countries in their nuclear endeavors.   Later, I had the opportunity to speak at length with John Yoshinari of Hitachi     GE, and Jeff Simmons of Luminant, both of whom offered invaluable national and international insight to the future of nuclear power. In May, I will be studying abroad in Tokyo, Japan, where my newfound international perspective will be useful.   While there, in part due to my participation in the Baker Forum, I will have the unique opportunity to visit one of the Japanese nuclear fuel reprocessing facilities.   I treat this as a chance to see the cooperation between the United States and Japan firsthand, and to reinforce my belief in the future of the industry.   Attending the Baker Forum allowed me to see that nuclear engineering is a global profession, with international partnerships and opportunities that will undoubtedly broaden my experience and enrich my career. By Brady Miller I had the opportunity to attend a conference entitled    The Post-Fukushima World  Nuclear Energy Policy, Regulation and Markets,    sponsored by the Howard Baker Forum. Top industry executives and government officials discussed the recent Fukushima crisis and their implications on the future of the nuclear industry. I learned many important lessons, including the power of simplicity, the developing relationship between political and energy independence, and the career range in engineering. Many top executives started out in completely different fields, and advised me to think of myself not simply as a nuclear engineer, but as an engineer specializing in energy.

Murray   s appointment as Baker Center director is for three years  he will continue to work with CBER during that time. Senator Baker said he is enthusiastic about what   s been happening at the center and what its future holds.    I think Carl did a tremendous job helping us rethink the role of the Baker Center and begin its transition. I now look forward to working with him on a variety of projects with the hope that these efforts may benefit future generations of public servants,    he said.    Meanwhile, I welcome Matt as the new director of the Baker Center. I   m confident his leadership will help it evolve as a thought-leader, both on campus and also with state and national leaders.

Howard Baker was president of the University of Tennessee student body from 1948-49.   Now our Baker Scholars, Ambassadors and Learning Community students are following in his footsteps. Lisa Dicker, Baker Ambassador (2010 Baker Learning Community) As a student who is highly involved in the Baker Center, I know from personal experience the value the center places on instilling in students not only the understanding of how policy affects our lives, but also the ability to mobilize and affect change in those policies through civic engagement.   We have learned that even as students we can be a force of change on any policy level from local to national level  however, recently, many students affiliated with the Baker Center have chosen to focus on a level that effects our daily lives perhaps more than any other institution    the university itself.   Many of us are unsatisfied with the lack of student influence in administrative decisions that greatly impact the student body.   The voice of the students should be the Student Government Association, but unfortunately, SGA has not been the force demanding student influence and input.   Thus, not only was the SGA REVOLT campaign was born, but also students have began voicing concerns about the state of SGA in other manners as well.   The election campaign is filled with students who are affiliated in one way or another with the Baker Center.   Here are just a few of the students who are involved in some manner with the election  Eric Dixon is currently campaigning for Student Government Association Vice President.   The former Baker Center Learning Community and second-year Baker Scholar is the candidate for the Revolt campaign.   With Eric   s guidance and leadership, REVOLT has launched a policy-driven campaign focusing on student influence in administrative decisions including task forces, student fee allocation, and university budgeting. Alexandra Chiasson is a freshman who is a REVOLT senatorial candidate.   She is a member of the Baker Center Learning Community and recently wrote a letter to the editor in the Beacon giving a freshman perspective on SGA, especially regarding recent administrative decisions and questions    Where was SGA?    Blair Kuykendall is a 2009 Learning Community member and second-year Baker Scholar, the editor of the Daily Beacon and thus, remains unaffiliated with either campaign.   Blair has, however, taken an active role in prompting voting and informed decisions by the student body in the upcoming elections.   http   utdailybeacon.com opinion columns guest 2012 feb 15 sga-campaign-2012-here-we-go-again  Elizabeth Williams and Madeline Brown  are 2008 Learning Community members, Baker Scholars and UT seniors.   Elizabeth is assisting the campaign with writing policy briefings and speeches and Maddie is the group s photographer. Students from the Baker Center have become a driving force in this election, especially in the policy-driven REVOLT campaign.   For years we have been taught the value of our collective and individual voices and that when we see an issue in a current institution, we truly can change it.   As a senatorial candidate and campaign exec member for REVOLT, I can attest to the fact that my experience and lessons from the Baker Center have enabled be to be the influence that I am in the current campaign.   Whether it be through membership in a campaign, contributions in media, or voting the Baker Center students will have a large impact in this year   s SGA election.

Alex Pfaff, from Duke University will give a 45 minute presentation and then lead a discussion with participants. His talk is titled       Avoided Amazonian Deforestation and Policy Design    Description  We examine how protection type, specifically variation in permission for local livelihoods, interacts with protection location so different types have different impacts on deforestation.   We study 2000-2004 and 2004- 2008 deforestation for Acre State, in the Brazilian Amazon, using matching to improve baselines. This control for site features lowers estimates by half. Sustainable-use areas avoid more clearing, despite the most clearing inside their boundaries. One reason is that on average other protection types are located further from deforestation, for instance further from roads and further from cities, implying little pressure to be blocked. Alex Pfaff is is Associate Professor of Public Policy, Economics and Environment and an environmental and natural resource economist focused upon how economic development and the environment & natural resources affect each other. His research examines  impacts on deforestation of roads, protected areas and ecopayments (Brazil s Amazon, Costa Rica, Bolivia, Peru, Mexico and US)  influences on harmful exposures (stove emissions in China and Pakistan, drinking arsenic in Bangladesh)  responses to climate and water shocks in production and bargaining under water policies (Brazil s NE and Colombia)  and how U.S. regulators might shift the incentives for firms to audit and provide information. This applied research aims to raise the chance that interventions have their intended impacts upon the environment and natural resources while benefiting all the people and groups they are designed to help. The Baker Center discussion forum is an opportunity for academics to share their research findings to a broad set of academics, researchers, and students from outside their own discipline but who have a common interest in environmental and energy issues.

On Friday March 30 - Sunday April 1, Baker Ambassador Lisa Dicker and Baker Scholar Jordan Smith attended the Harvard Institute of Politics National Campaign for Political and Civic Engagement Annual Conference as the delegates from the University of Tennessee.   The Institute of Politics is housed in Harvard   s John F. Kennedy School of Government.   The National Campaign is a consortium of 20   colleges and universities and focuses its efforts on engaging youth in politics as well as promoting political civility.   The conference was attended by over forty students and nearly a dozen faculty and staff from across the nation. The topic of this year   s conference was    Mobilization.      Lisa and Jordan spent the weekend attending lectures and workshops on how to best mobilize and engage youth in the political process, and topics ranged from Blue State Digital   s presentation on the impact of electronic and social media on political campaigns to the Kennedy School   s Director of Polling, John Della Volpe   s, lecture on youth attitudes towards the political process and involvement tendencies.   The conference was designed to educate the delegates on the issues facing youth involvement (such as new voter ID laws), to allow an open forum for discussion on how to overcome such obstacles, and to develop effective, implementable plans that the delegates can bring back to their respective institutions.    It is wonderful to connect with other students to discuss the initiatives taking place at their institutions, brainstorm together, and be able to bring those ideas back to the Baker Center and UT to assist with our own initiatives.   The contacts made and innovative ideas developed at the conference are invaluable.    Lisa commented. Along with conference activities and networking with other universities, the students also had the opportunity to explore Boston in the evenings and experienced everything from standing on the spot of the Boston Massacre to enjoying cannoli in the North End. Upon returning to UT, Jordan Smith stated,    The conference at Harvard highlighted the best efforts around the nation to curb the problem of low turnout among youth voters.   As a Baker Scholar and an involved member of my community, I was inspired and motivated to bring similar programs and ideas back to UT and the Baker Center.

Promoting Investments in Energy Efficient Technologies    A Natural Field Experiment on the Relative Importance of Prices and Frames Dr. Scott Holladay, Dr. Jacob LaRiviere and Dr. Michael Price, Department of Economics  and  Dr. John A. List, University of Chicago Department of Economics and Gary Becker Center for Price Theory Summary  This project is designed to assess the importance of public and private incentives for households to invest in electricity conservation.   Consumers will be provided with information on how their monthly household energy usage compares to their neighbors and offered an opportunity to participate in an energy audit, which identifies and subsidizes possible energy conserving home improvements.   The offers will couch the benefits of energy conservation in terms of either public benefits of energy conservation (reduced pollution, lower probability of blackouts) or the private benefits (reductions in household electric bills).   Consumer billing data provided by Knoxville Utilities Board will be used to track energy usage among these consumers over time. There has been considerable research that shows that behavior cues can have small, but measurable impacts on household energy consumption at very low costs.   There is also evidence that these behavioral programs and the framing of their benefits have heterogeneous impacts across consumers.   This project will expand the existing literature by using social norms to encourage consumers to invest in household efficiency.   Priming consumers to think about the public or private benefits of energy conservation will allow us to search for differences in elasticities across different types of benefits.   Tracking energy consumption over time will allow for an evaluation of the effectiveness of the energy audit program relative to the behavioral nudges described in the literature. Developing Short Course Certificate Programs for Nuclear Security Professionals Dr. Howard Hall, Nuclear Engineering  Dr. Arlene Garrison, ORAU  Jim Summer, ORNL  and  Joe Stainback, Y-12 Summary  The partners of the newly formed UT Institute for Nuclear Security (INS), housed in the Baker Center, will develop and organize certificate training programs that can fill the needs of industry professionals and their organizations.   Certificate training programs provide a means for personnel to remain up-to-date on the latest trends and technologies in the nuclear security field as well as offering the opportunity to improve and expand their professional capabilities. Developing a Water-Energy Nexus White Paper for East Tennessee Dr. Carol Harden, Department of Geography  Dr. Christopher Clark, Department of Agriculture and Resource Economic  and Dr. John Schwartz, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering Summary  In recognition of the needs and opportunities for vastly increasing the research and policy contributions of the University of Tennessee to the water-energy nexus, a short-term initiative (June through September 2012) will occur to collect geo-spatial data and produce a white paper intended to set the stage for a longer-term, interdisciplinary research and educational focus on policy-relevant water energy issues. Electric Versus Traditional Motorized Vehicles in the Southeast    Comparison of GHG Emissions and Exposure and Health Impacts of Primary Pollutants Dr. Christopher Cherry and Shuguang   Ji, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering Summary  Electric vehicles are often viewed as producing zero emissions despite the fact that they often depend on charging capacity derived from fossil fuels.   This research will compare greenhouse gas (GHG) emission and health impacts of emissions from fine particulate pollution from electric and traditional motorized vehicles to inform transportation energy policy in the Southeast. Modeling and Experimental Validation of Socio-Cultural Opinion Evolution (SCOPE) in Strongly Networked Societies Dr. Matthew M. Mench and Dr. Subhadeep Chakraborty, Department of Mechanical, Aerospace, and Biomedical Engineering Summary  The recent world-wide    Arab-Spring    events have made it clear that the impact of online social networking is both enormous and immediate, and is not well-understood.   The rapid dissemination in highly networked societies results in accelerated political decision timelines and sharply changing opinion dynamics that cannot be fully grasped with traditional approaches.   The objective of this work is to validate an advanced model, developed with a novel language-theoretic framework, for stochastic simulation of a person   s decision-making process in a social setting, with the inclusion of individual influence through his her social interactions, including rapidly evolving online social networking, embedded virtual agents, and naturally occurring global (political) events. Developing a Large Unified Database and Query Program for Energy Markets Dr Jacob LaRiviere, Dr. Michael Price, and Dr. Scott Holladay, UT Dept. Economics Summary  This grant will support an undergraduate math student in his efforts to continue merging six disparate datasets in the computing language R, a very flexible matrix based statistical computing language. This work supplements a larger research agenda in which the co-PIs are assembling a data set comprising hourly emissions data, hourly electricity pricing data, hourly weather data, daily commodities data, quarterly power plant fixed effects and yearly disparate state level gas and oil well data, using Baker Center graduate research associates.   The larger research agenda identifies the effects of new drilling technology on the composition of electricity generation in the US and identifies forgone emissions due to various demand augmentation policies. Workshop on    Energy in East Asia  Past, Present, and the Future    Dr. Shellen Xiao Wu, Dept. of History Summary  This workshop will be held in commemoration of the 30th Anniversary of the 1982 Knoxville International Energy Exposition, September 27-28, 2012.   As the headquarters of the Tennessee Valley Authority and in close proximity to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Knoxville is uniquely situated for the study of energy in all forms.   In 2012 the issue of energy, from large-scale public power projects, the exploitation of natural resources, to the ecological impact of war and development, is at the forefront of exciting new research in East Asian history.   This workshop will explore the various facets of exciting new research in the East Asian context.   Papers will be sought to address the following issues    the exploitation of natural resources, state sponsored power projects, scientific and technological innovations (as related to energy), conservation and ecology.   The goal of this workshop is to foster academic collaboration between scholars of East Asia working on the issue of energy, as well as to produce a publication from the papers of the proceedings. The Impact of Carbon Policies on Supply Chain Design and Logistic Operations of a Major Retailer Dr. Mingzhou Jin, Industrial and Information Engineering and Dr. Ian Down, Political Science Summary  The aim of this project is to better understand how various carbon emissions policies influence individual enterprises    supply chain design and logistics operations.   It is believed that a better micro-level understanding will help policy makers to predict the impact of policy on overall emissions in the freight transportation sector. Lobby and Special Districts    External Actors and America   s Invisible Governments Dr. Anthony Nownes and John Coles, PhD candidate, Dept. of Political Science Summary  This study will look at how and to what effect special district governing boards interact with interest groups in the US.   We plan to survey special district governing board executives about their interactions with interest groups and citizens.   Special districts are the    invisible government    of the American federal system.   They do their work in obscurity and seldom attract attention from citizens or the media.   They have also received little research attention.   This research is important   given that influential theoretical work suggests that interest groups have profound effects on the decisions of these governing boards (Berry 2009, but empirical work on this is non-existent. Survey of Tennessee Residents    Energy Perceptions Dr. Bruce Tonn, Political Science and Dr. John Sanseverino, UT Research Foundation Summary  Tennessee currently stands at the cusp of a possible energy transformation.   Emerging technologies and resources, such as solar, wind, and hydrofracking, have the potential of creating a new statewide energy landscape.   This transformation could affect the lives and livelihoods of residents, businesses, and institutions across the state.   Yet, despite this potential impact, opinions of Tennesseans are largely unknown.   To date, public opinion has largely been dominated by cadres of advocates and detractors, and the voices of most citizens have not been effectively heard. In an effort to remedy this deficiency, a survey will be done of Tennessee residents about energy resources and energy-related issues.   The survey, distributed across a range of residents, will gauge opinions and perceptions of resources, strategies, responsibilities, and technologies.   Topics might include    renewable resources, nuclear power, coal transition, alternate fuel or electric vehicles, hydrofracking, and energy-efficiency. Reducing Transportation Network Vulnerability Dr. Megan Ryerson, Dept. Civil and Environmental Engineering and Dr. Hyun Kim, Dept. of Geography Summary  In the airline industry, natural disasters and acts of terrorism introduce    irregular operations,    or a sudden change to the planned system.   The aviation system is particularly vulnerable to irregular operations due to its most basic characteristics    time-critical passengers and freight moving at high speeds on a hub and spoke network directed by a strict schedule.   If an outage occurs at a hub airport, passengers and goods transferring at the impacted hub will be impeded unnecessarily.   Such an outage highlights the vulnerability of the transportation network.   This research will propose a methodology to identify a hierarchy of hubs in an aviation system network and determine an alternative hub structure to adopt when one hub experiences an outage.","link":"http:\/\/bakercenter.utk.edu\/baker-center-rfp-awards-april-2012\/"},{"title":"Baker Scholar Named Torchbearer!","content":"Baker Scholar Named Torchbearer!

Baker   s role in the passage of the Panama Canal Treaties Recent UT International Business graduate and   Baker   Scholar, Hadil Senno, completed her Baker Scholar project with this paper --    The Great Conciliator and US Foreign Policy - Learning from Former Senator Howard Baker, Jr s Example during the Panama Canal Treaties Ratification.     You can read it here    http   bakercenter.utk.edu wp-content uploads 2012 06 Hadil-Senno-Baker-Scholar-Research.pdf Hadil used the Modern Political Archives to research the topic and she conducted interviews with Sen. Baker and Amb. Thomas Graham.   Her research   provides an   overview of the controversy surrounding the treaty and Baker s handling of the issue.   As you may remember, Sen. Baker went against the Republican party and supported the treaty ratification, because he felt it was the right thing to do and it was best for the country.    Hadil noted that Sen. Baker s example is a good one for present -day politicians to examine.      She says,  The first striking characteristic of the process through which Baker evaluated the Panama Canal treaties was the tremendous thoroughness of his efforts...extensive Foreign Relations Committee hearings...his trip to Panama...as well as the meticulous assessment of details of each clause (in the treaties)...to be fully informed...    (p. 16).      In her interview with Sen. Baker she asked him how he dealt with the overwhelming number of opinions from outsiders, to which he said,  You can t afford to totally ignore that, but you can t afford to be totally captured by it either.  (p. 16).    Hadil concluded with a quote from John F. Kenney,  it is...the compromisers and conciliators...who are faced with the severest tests of political courage as they oppose the extremist views of their constituents. (p. 20).   She states that   Sen. Baker passed that test with flying colors and Senators today should strive for the same.

UT s Life of the Mind program featured author Eric Liu and his book,  The Accidental Asian,  which was chosen for incoming freshmen to read this year.   In an address to student leaders working with the 2012 incoming freshman, he urged students to create a  spirit of permission  so everyone s voice can be heard.   He noted that today s society cannot be one of    raw individualism  as some proclaim, as this never got a barn raised.    We aren t just individuals, but we are part of a web of mutual responsibility and everything we do or don t do becomes rapidly contagious.   For example,   if you decide to be civil, those around you are civil.   If you are compassionate, those around you will be compassionate. He told the students that they have the capacity to shape and mold habits of leadership for these incoming students.    He pointed to his more recent book   Gardens of Democracy,  as a better metaphor for society and he  noted Sen. Baker several times in his talk as one who emulated this concept.

George Mitchell, a long-time statesman and attorney, will be at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, on Tuesday, November 13, to deliver the inaugural Baker Distinguished Lecture. This new program was established to promote the values of Senator Howard H. Baker, Jr., whose longstanding commitment to honorable public service has made an indelible mark on US history. Free and open to the public, the lecture   sponsored by the Howard H. Baker Jr. Center for Public Policy, SunTrust Bank, Knoxville News Sentinel and WUOT   will begin at 2 00 p.m. in the Cox Auditorium of Alumni Memorial Building.The Baker Distinguished Lecture Series will bring nationally prominent speakers to campus twice a year to speak on issues of national and international significance.   The program is particularly important to Sen. Baker.   In 1999 he was a speaker at the Landon Lecture at Kansas State University. The Landon Lecture   is named for former Kansas Governor, Alfred Landon, who is the late father of Sen. Baker   s wife, Sen. Nancy Landon Kassebaum (Baker). Senator Mitchell, a Democrat from Maine, served in the US Senate from 1980 to 1995 and was majority leader during the final six years of his tenure. He has since served as a peace negotiator and in several high-profile investigative roles. In 1995, he founded the Mitchell Institute, which seeks to increase the likelihood that young people from every community in Maine will go to college.  The institute has awarded more than $9 million in scholarships to more than 2,000 Maine students. Appointed by President Bill Clinton, Mitchell served as chairman of the peace negotiations in Northern Ireland from 1995 to 2001 and also served as chairman of an international fact finding committee on violence in the Middle East from 2000 to 2001. From 2009 to 2011, he was the Special Envoy for the Middle East, appointed by President Barack Obama. In 2006, he was asked by the Commissioner of Baseball to lead an investigation of the use of performance-enhancing drugs in professional baseball. Earlier this year, the NCAA named Mitchell as Penn State   s Athletics Integrity Monitor. In the business arena, Mitchell has been director and chairman of the board of the Walt Disney Company. He also has served as on the board of directors of Federal Express Corp., Xerox Corp., Unilever, Staples Inc., Starwood Hotels and Resorts, and the Boston Red Sox baseball team.

Butler is a former VP at the Washington Post and is presently CEO of the Association of Public Television Stations Trey Grayson, Director of the Harvard Institute of Politics and former Kentucky Secretary of State, he   has been called a    rising star    and is known for his dedication to civil debate and bipartisanship. His longing to connect both sides of the political aisle can be seen through his discourses with Democratic Representative, Gabby Gifford, whom he said could best be honored by politicians assembling to create bipartisan solutions. Ira Shapiro was a  long-time Senate staffer, Clinton administration trade ambassador, and author, has spent much of his career defining ethics in the Senate. Always working for what he believes, Ira Shapiro has dealt with some of the most difficult trade negotiations imaginable and ran a congressional campaign based on his opposition to President George Bush   s tax cuts.   He is author of the new book, The Last Great Senate, and will sign copies following the discussion. Tom Griscom has seen both sides of the problem, as a political staffer and newspaper editor.   Currently serving as a media consultant, Tom was the communications director for President Ronald Reagan, and a staffer to Senator Howard Baker, prior to serving as the editor of the Chattanooga Times Free Press.

A new report, Getting Back to Legislating,  by Don Wolfensberger, is posted on the Woodrow Wilson Center website.   It was prepared for the Wilson Center and the Bipartisan Policy Center, both groups the Baker Center and Sen. Baker have worked with. Wolfensberger, a scholar at both centers makes the following recommendations for  fixing Congress.  Highlighted Proposals for Positive Change  Leaders should commit to five-day workweeks, with three weeks on and one week off. Congress should adopt biennial budget resolutions and spin-off the discretionary spending and debt ceilings in the resolutions into a bill for enactment. Leadership should commit to fully restoring the authorization process to committees. Committee chairs should commit to full minority party participation in markups. Appropriations committees should refrain from authorizing in appropriations bills. A more open amendment process on the floor of each house should be allowed by limiting restrictive amendment rules in the House and avoiding    filling the amendment tree    in the Senate. Motions to proceed to consideration of legislation or nominations, and motions relating to going to conference in the Senate, should not be subject to filibuster.

Bjornstad and Alexandra Brewer Executive Summary With the presidential election decided, a renewed debate on energy and environmental issues will begin.   This Policy Brief can serve as a primer for assessing these issues. The  Brief  is divided into a short introduction and three topical sections.   The first section provides a short overview of the inputs offered by three influential groups to the debate over energy and environmental policy choices.   The first of these groups, the American Petroleum Institute, puts forth four principles, around which it argues the debate over policy should be organized.   The first principle, a commitment to access federal lands, calls for opening the potential energy portfolio to broad development.   The second principle, a commonsense regulatory environment, calls for greater regulatory certainty. The third principle calls for removing barriers to private sector energy investments, and the fourth calls for sustainability, interpreted as shifting the energy decision making balance from the public to the private sector.   In all, the approach avoids specific recommended actions, and recognizes the need for public oversight, while deferring key choices to the private sector. The second group, whose collection of work is provided in  Daedalus  (Spring 2012), seeks to reframe energy and environmental choices as integrating the private costs of energy production and use that are compensated through the prices paid by energy consumers, e.g., the payments to productive factors     land, labor and capital    with the uncompensated social costs that result from production and consumption, e.g., pollution, carbon emissions, damages to environmental resources, and the like. It is notable that regulations effectively internalize some of these costs  the key is to choose the proper level of regulation. The third group, a collection of papers by Brookings Institution scholars, seeks to reframe energy and environmental topics within the larger debate over taxes, federal debt, and job creation.   It would call, minimally, for carbon taxes that would provide incentives for carbon abatement while contributing to debt reduction, and for sensitivity to the global leadership role of the United States. The second section delves into the    tool box    that economists use to frame, constrain, and analyze policy topics.   In its simplest form, the economic approach seeks to define the choices to be made, to measure the entirety of costs and benefits these choices affect, and to analyze the fundamental tradeoffs that different choices imply.   The values of the governed are then used to evaluate tradeoffs.   For example, are the health risks to coal miners compensated or uncompensated costs?   How should regulators balance the personal choices of miners with the interests of the larger national community?   The conclusion is ultimately a value judgment, but one that should be reduced to its most fundamental terms to facilitate explication of basic choice elements and communication with affected stakeholders.   Other topics in this section include  market failure, benefit-costs analysis, considerations of future stakeholders, and conflicts between values and uncertainties. The third section introduces four topics that are likely to rise to the forefront as the energy environment policy debate evolves.   These include  climate change, regulation of fracking, choices over energy saving technologies and products that embody them, and the smart grid.   In each case, the elements of advice contained in section one can be applied to shape choice outcomes, and the tools of section two can be used to untangle the advice, or perhaps to tangle it more, at the user   s discretion. In all, it can be argued that there are no singular answers to energy environment choices, because answers follow from values, but that for any value set, choices can be improved through an open dialogue.   We encourage readers    comments, criticisms, and suggestions that may stimulate that dialogue.

BAKER JR. CENTER FOR PUBLIC POLICY COMPLETES TWO YEAR INTERNATIONAL DIALOGUE AND STUDY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY POLICY The Howard H. Baker Jr. Center for Public Policy, the European Commission, the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars organized the U.S-.E.U. Summit on Science, Technology, Innovation, and Sustainable Economic Growth. The Summit, sponsored by the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy, and the European Commission, examined the critical impacts of investments in science, technology, and innovation on sustainable economic growth. The Summit, whose activities extended over two years, explored the links between science and economic growth and included two meetings and four workshops. The Summit has proved unique in two important respects. First, it has prompted an interdisciplinary examination by leading scientists, economists, and policy analysts of the relationship between science and sustainable economic growth, tracing the process from discovery through technology development to sustainable economic growth. Second, the Summit has taken place at a time when policy is being discussed and developed to restructure the economy in a way that will affect long-term production and employment. The Summit began with a one-day meeting in Washington, D.C., on September 28, 2010. At this initial meeting, participants discussed how past linkages among investments in science, technology, and education have affected job creation, employment, and economic growth. While the Summit was designed to address the impact of science, technology, and innovation on sustainable economic growth, it has given specific attention to the critical areas of energy, water, and the environment and the necessary innovations for achieving a low-carbon economy. The Summit   s opening meeting was followed by four workshops held in 2011 at the Howard Baker Center in Knoxville, Tennessee  the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington, D.C.  the Paris School of International Affairs in Paris, France  and the European Commission   s Conference Center in Brussels, Belgium. The two U.S. workshops focused on energy and the critical link between energy and water. The third workshop, held in Paris, focused on energy security, and the fourth workshop, held in Brussels, explored innovation that is necessary to move toward a post-carbon economy. The Summit   s final plenary session convened September 11, 2012, at the Woodrow Wilson Center to summarize the findings and examine the implications of a post-carbon world.

Join us for the next Baker Center Energy and Environmental Forum, which will take place on Thursday, April 11 at 3.30 pm in  Min Kao 404 (not Toyota Auditorium in Baker Center due to scheduling conflict). Paulina Oliva, Assistant Professor of Economics at University of California, Santa Barbara will give a 45 minute presentation and then lead a discussion with participants. Her talk is titled     Does the Effect of Pollution on Infant Mortality Differ Between Developing and Developed Countries?    Evidence from Mexico City    Abstract  Much of what we know about the marginal effect of pollution on infant mortality is derived from developed country data. However, given the lower levels of air pollution in developed countries, these estimates may not be externally valid to the developing country context if there is a nonlinear dose relationship between pollution and mortality or if the costs of avoidance behavior differs considerably between the two contexts. In this paper, we estimate the relationship between pollution and infant mortality using data from Mexico. We find that an increase of 1 parts per billion in carbon monoxide (CO) over the last week results in 0.0032 deaths per 100,000 births, while a 1   g m3 increase in particulate matter (PM10) results in 0.24 infant deaths per 100,000 births. Our estimates for PM10 tend to be similar (or even smaller) than the U.S. estimates, while our findings on CO tend to be larger than those derived from the U.S. context. We provide suggestive evidence that a non-linearity in the relationship between CO and health explains this difference. Paulina Olivia is Assistant Professor of Economics at University of California, Santa Barbara.    Her research focuses on the effects of pollution and policies for pollution mitigation in the developing world.    She has served as a referee on NSF panels, won multiple grants and presented extensively throughout North America, Latin America and Europe.    She is a faculty affiliate of the Center for Effective Global Action at UC Berkeley and a faculty research fellow at the National Bureau of Economic Research.

In the budget   s chapter on    Creating a 21st Century Government,    under the heading    Reform TVA,    there is a one paragraph discussion of the Tennessee Valley Authority. It concludes with this statement   Given TVA s debt constraints and the impact to the Federal deficit of its increasing capital expenditures, the Administration intends to undertake a strategic review of options for addressing TVA s financial situation, including the possible divestiture of TVA, in part or as a whole.  Read full policy brief. A number of divestiture scenarios are possible. For example  (1) TVA could be acquired by a single investor-owned utility (IOU). This scenario is unlikely, especially if the IOU operates in the Southeast, because the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) probably would object to its stifling effects on wholesale electricity competition. (2) TVA could be divided up among IOUs in the Southeast. This is more likely to be acceptable to FERC. (3) TVA could remain a wholly-owned federal corporation, but some of its assets could be sold to IOUs and or independent power producers. This is also a plausible scenario. If pursued, the main issue would be which assets and with what effect on what remained of TVA. The possibilities are numerous, and it is premature to speculate about the outcome of the Obama administration   s review. Therefore, this policy brief mainly summarizes factors that should be taken into account in that review. The brief begins with background information. It ends with a list of key points relevant to the prospective decision about TVA.","link":"http:\/\/bakercenter.utk.edu\/should-the-federal-government-sell-tva\/"},{"title":"Baker Center Honors 2013 Baker Scholars!","content":"Baker Center Honors 2013 Baker Scholars!

His research on transportation alternatives in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park helped create a private shuttle system to relieve traffic congestion in this heavily visited national pa rk. More recently, Sims has been interested in the economic dimensions of managing natural forest disturbances (such as insect outbreaks and wildfires) as well as the application of financial economic models to the control of invasive species, habitat conservation, and pollution. He has also worked closely with state and local governments, federal agencies, and interdisciplinary groups of researchers on a wide variety of issues including recreation management on public lands, economic impact analysis of coal and natural gas extraction, and water management in irrigated landscapes.

The research was funded by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT).   Dr. Greene was aided by University of Tennessee graduate student, Sangsoo Park, Department of Economics, and Changzheng Liu, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, Tennessee. This report,  Transition to Electric Drive 2013 report.FINAL, describes an effort to model the transition to electric drive vehicles in California, including  measuring the costs and benefits, quantifying the transition barriers and network external benefits,  and estimating the effects of public policies on the transition process. The study used the  Light-duty Alternative Vehicle and Energy Transitions  (LAVE-Trans) model developed for this project. It was designed to measure external benefits, albeit imperfectly. Recognizing and measuring the value of early deployment of vehicles and infrastructure at a time when it might appear to be uneconomical is an important part of understanding the new paradigm for energy transitions.   It is hoped that future research and analysis will narrow the uncertainties and develop improved tools to support public policy decisions.   In the meantime, this report provides insight that should prove valuable for continued research and policy decisions.

Those policies resulted in a drastic decline in activity in the industry, concerns about    energy independence    and increases in imports to approximately 60% of US demand for crude by 2008.   With the advent and wider-implementation of new exploration and production technologies, specifically horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, this picture has been altered. Since 2008, the US has sharply reduced dependence on imports to roughly 40% of domestic crude consumption  and, the US could become a net exporter of crude by 2030 as well as LNG. However, existing policies can impede reaching that goal. Further, new domestic demands for natural gas for electricity generation, industrial production, and transportation may alter this picture  and, changes internationally in sources of supply would result in increased competition for markets. Finally, uncertainties due to expanded environmental regulation or changes in tax treatment of the industry could increase finding costs and reduce drilling activity. When all of these factors are considered, the future of the US petroleum industry is not clear-cut. Lorna Greening is co-editor of Energy Policy, an international peer-reviewed journal addressing the policy implications of energy supply and use from their economic, social, planning and environmental aspects. In addition to her responsibilities with the journal she is an economic consultant and researcher based in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Lorna received a BS from the University of Michigan, and later received a doctorate in economics from the Colorado School of Mines. She has well over 30 years of experience in the energy industry, including consulting, research, academia, the public utility industry, and the petroleum industry as an exploration geologist.

James Shortle, Professor of Agricultural and Environmental Economics, and Director of the Environment and Natural Resources Institute, at Penn State University will give a 45 minute presentation and then lead a discussion with participants. His talk is titled         Towards a Science of Water Quality Trading    Abstract  The potential for pollution trading in markets to efficiently achieve environmental-quality goals is one of the major conceptual innovations for environmental policy coming from economic research.   Successful applications in air pollution control have contributed to interest in using trading in other environmental domains.   However, water pollution problems generally do not conform closely to the assumptions of conventional economic models of efficient trading.    I will describe challenges to the design of water pollution markets that can efficiently manage water pollution.   I will describe how recent experiments in water quality trading have attempted to  address these issues in water quality protection and offer lessons for market design.   Finally, I will offer suggestions for key elements of a multi-disciplinary approach for determining and realizing the promise of water quality markets. James Shortle is the University Distinguished Professor of Agricultural and Environmental Economics, and Director of the Environment and Natural Resources Institute, at Penn State University.   He received his PhD in Economics from Iowa State University in 1981 and has been at Penn State since.   His current research focuses on the design of economic incentives and markets for water quality protection, environmental policy for agriculture, and impacts of climate change on agriculture and water resources.   He is a member of the Environmental Economics Advisory Committee to the US EPA Science Advisory Board, and recently served on the National Research Council Committee on Science for EPAs Future.

Info Sessions The Baker Center is excited to announce our second annual student policy challenge for the 2014 15 school year. We have expanded our challenge, using the University of Pennsylvania   s Fels Institute Penn Policy Challenge as a model, and renaming our Challenge, the  Howard Baker Public Policy Challenge  in honor of the late Senator. This year, we invite  undergraduate and graduate students  from all disciplines to compete on teams, developing policy recommendations and action plans to combat REAL local and state issues. Through semi-final and final competitions in November and February we will determine one winning team and two runners-up to be awarded $3,000 and $1,000 cash prizes, respectively, to further their policy initiatives. If invited, the winning team will compete in the Penn National Challenge in March 2015 for even larger prizes. Students will be placed on teams with a faculty mentor based on common interests and complementary skills. The goal of the Howard Baker Public Policy Challenge is to provide first-hand experiences in the public policy process and engage students in their community. (This is experiential learning at its best!) Students will utilize research and critical analysis skills to determine the best policy to combat a specific issue. Teams must then develop an action plan that takes stakeholders, community leaders, budget, and jurisdictional restraints into consideration. Participants will also build valuable networking and leadership skills that can be carried into the professional world. We will lead two workshops during the challenge, teaching students about the public policy process and effective communication skills. All  students are encourage to apply online  here   to participate in this one-of-a-kind opportunity. The deadline to sign up is Sept. 12. This program will strengthen knowledge of state and local government and politics, public policy and administration, organizational behavior, and public finance. In addition, teams will work with local stakeholders and focus on specific subject areas, such as sustainability and environmental policy, public health, or education policy and learn invaluable skills in the policy process, teamwork, leadership and presentation skills. Two information sessions will be offered - Wed., August 27, 3 30 pm and Tuesday, Sept. 2, 5 15 pm in the Toyota Auditorium.

As you will see, these issues affect millions of Americans all across the country. Students    research in these areas will benefit communities throughout the United States and the world. East Tennessee Quality Growth - The greater Knoxville region is currently challenged by the dual forces of an aging skilled workforce retiring and the difficulty of attracting and retaining millennials needed to fill those jobs and the jobs for emerging economic clusters.   Existing focus groups meet to discuss attraction and retention of labor, but there continues to be a migration of millennials to other areas of the country.   Also, Tennessee lags in educational attainment and companies must recruit workers to the area to fill existing jobs.   The cost of recruitment and training is a significant investment.   Tennessee is also benefiting from an increase in industry relocation.   Millennials are needed in the current workforce to replace aging workers in highly skilled positions, to fill leadership roles in the community.   How do we solve this problem --- how do we attract millennials and keep them and help foster policy that changes the perception that this region is not inclusive?   Tennessee Advisory Committee on Intergovernmental Relations (TACIR) recommended a number of issues on which they have been working. One idea was for the creation of an uninsured motorist database to help the Department of Safety enforce compliance with the Financial Responsibility Law. Another area of interest for TACIR was the creation of new funding mechanisms for emergency communication services and the efficiency of systems already in place. Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT) is interested in encouraging more cargo shipping via barge and rail versus tractor-trailer to reduce negative environmental effects and improve road safety. TDOT has also been concerned with the recent increases in distracted driving and automobile deaths due to unrestrained passengers (seat belt usage). Knoxville Metropolitan Drug Commission has expressed concern over the high number of women addicted to opioids and a new state law that criminalizes mothers of children born with Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome. Knoxville League of Women Voters seeks to increase the participation of eligible voters in the Knox area. They are looking for innovative ideas to  (1) register eligible voters, (2) ensure voters are engaged and informed, and (3) vote regularly in state and local elections. Additionally, East Tennessee Quality Growth is trying to retain highly skilled millennials in the Knoxville area to improve our business competitiveness and community leadership. Knoxville Knox County Food Policy Council has provided two issues.   Food prices have increased by 30% over the past 6 years. Over this same period the number of people in poverty has increased.   National SNAP-benefit expenditures have mushroomed to over $70 billion per year, and Congress routinely threatens to cut program expenditures.   How can we increase food access to those in poverty without increasing government expenses? Community gardens have been started around Knoxville but they have not been successful to date in increasing food access to the poor.   Problems include lack of gardening knowledge, poor soils, no access to water, and gardens located too far from people   s kitchens. Are there other policies that can increase direct access to the poor? More gardens? Neighborhood composting? City garden education classes? Edible landscaping in public spaces?   Please help us figure out if these ideas (or new ideas) can increase direct access of good food to the poor. Food prices have increased by 30% over the past 6 years and over this same period a direct correlation between energy prices and food prices has emerged.   If energy prices continue to increase, food prices will likely increase too.   Increasing the amount of food grown (with low-input methods) within the Knoxville Foodshed has been proposed as a way to increase resilience of our food supply by reducing transportation and production costs (Hellwinckel et al. 2014). Yet barriers exist such as  lack of training programs for new farmers, high land values, small current market for local food, institutions like schools and hospitals unwilling (or unable) to buy local at a slightly higher price.   We need people going into farming now to avoid price or supply disruptions in the near future, but attracting, training, and providing a comfortable living (now) are challenges.   Help us figure out policies to make farming a viable option for the young.

This talk discusses two research projects related to possible environmental benefits of fracking  first, we use a regional specific electricity dispatch model to predict what the causal effect of natural gas price decreases (due to fracking) are for coal fired electricity generation.   We then match those causal changes to detailed air quality monitor data to estimate the causal effect of the price decrease on changes in air quality.   Second, we estimate how the decrease in natural gas prices has asymmetrically affected the emissions profile from electricity generation in different US regions throughout the day.   This lets us link the effects of fracking to changes in various pollution outcomes from different energy policies, paying specific attention to renewable generation sources like wind.   The talk highlights the importance of analyzing both the costs and benefits in determining both regional and national energy policies.

Diana and Morgan are co-chairs of the Voter Registration Committee within the Baker Ambassador program at the Baker Center.     Before attending the conference, they were asked to select an issue as their focus for the 2014-15 year and they decided to create a project for voting rights and accessibility.   Their main focus for the project was to register as many students and Knoxville residents as possible.   They also handed out information about absentee ballots and precinct locations.   They set up voter registration booths at Market Square in Knoxville, UT pedestrian walkway, and Hodges library, resulting in 120 new voters registered. Currently, the planning for an open forum is underway with members of organizations across all disciplines to discuss the issue on voter turnout. This event     Making Voting Popular - is planned for Oct. 30, 7 30 pm in the Toyota Auditorium. The Harvard Institute of Politics National Campaign Conference ran from Saturday, September 27 to Sunday, September 28.   On Friday, Diana and Morgan attended a welcome reception which gave them the opportunity to meet their fellow National Campaign Ambassadors.   On Saturday, there were many different workshops that ranged from negotiation, effective communication and facilitating conversation. Howell stated,    I especially enjoyed hearing from Representative Stacey Abrams, House minority leader in the Georgia General Assembly, who spoke on effective means of achieving bipartisan agreements. She spoke on how bipartisanship can be achieved by finding a way the other s ide might agree on your idea for their own reasons. She also spoke on the importance of informing yourself and understanding the other side   s beliefs.    There was also a panel of fellow Millennials who are politically active and a panel on politics and advocacy. Morgan Chance stated,    We learned many different skills from these talks and workshops like how to work across party lines and how to effectively speak to a large group of people.    On Sunday, Diana and Morgan collaborated with the other Ambassadors who are also focusing on voting rights and accessibility.   They spoke with Trey Grayson, former Secretary of State of Kentucky and Director of the Harvard IOP, who gave each student feedback on their projects.   They shared how they received very useful information from Mr. Grayson that will be used in their projects. Morgan later said,    Diana and I had a wonderful time at the conference and learned so much to bring back to campus.   We appreciate the opportunity to represent the University of Tennessee and the Baker Center at this interesting and useful conference.

We have expanded our challenge, using the University of Pennsylvania   s Fels Institute Penn Policy Challenge as a model, and renaming our Challenge, the Howard Baker Public Policy Challenge in honor of the late Senator. This year, we invite undergraduate and graduate students from all disciplines to compete on teams, developing policy recommendations and action plans to combat a variety of local and state issues. Through semi-final and final competitions in November and February we will determine one winning team and two runners-up to be awarded $3,000 and $1,000 cash prizes, respectively, to further their policy initiatives. If invited, the winning team will compete in the Penn National Challenge in March 2015. Students will be placed on teams with a graduate student and faculty mentor based on common interests and complementary skills. The goal of the Howard Baker Public Policy Challenge is to provide first-hand experiences in the public policy process and engage students in their community. (This is experiential learning at its best!) Students will utilize research and critical analysis skills to determine the best policy to combat a specific issue. Teams must then develop an action plan that takes stakeholders, community leaders, budget, and jurisdictional restraints into consideration. Participants will also build valuable networking and leadership skills that can be carried into the professional world. We will lead two workshops during the challenge, teaching students about the public policy process and effective communication skills. All students are encourage to apply online here to participate in this one-of-a-kind opportunity. The deadline to sign up is Sept. 12. This program will strengthen knowledge of state and local government and politics, public policy and administration, organizational behavior, and public finance. In addition, teams will work with local stakeholders and focus on specific subject areas, such as sustainability and environmental policy, public health, or education policy and learn invaluable skills in the policy process, teamwork, leadership and presentation skills. Two information sessions will be offered - Wed., August 27, 3 30 pm and Tuesday, Sept. 2, 5 15 pm in the Toyota Auditorium.

The current process greatly restricts clients    awareness of job openings and puts them at a number of disadvantages. Compounding that problem is the method of finding and monitoring employment opportunities for Families First recipients is not uniform across the state and is not up to par with current technologies. We look to create a jobs database specifically for Families First clients to be included in Families First Policy that builds on underutilized resources and allows them to apply for jobs in a modern way, quickly and efficiently. The new resource would also allow Families First employees to track the applicant   s progress, more easily identify barriers to employment, and measure program outcomes in a consistent manner across the state. This would directly address multiple issues within this complex problem. Ian Barry is a graduate student in the Masters of Science in Social Work (MSSW) with an emphasis on Evidence Based Interpersonal Practice (EBIP). He graduated in 2012 with his bachelors in Russian Literature. His topic of interest in the UT Howard Baker Center Policy Challenge is Poverty. He is specifically interested in using modern technological innovation to address an old and consistent problem. He hopes that by making investments in technology, solutions to the problems of poverty can be found. Joey Carr is a second year student in the University of Tennessee s Master of Science in Social Work program.

Rachel hopes to become a licensed architect and focus on the restoration and historical preservation of structures within cities. Rachel received an email about the policy challenge from the School of Architecture at UTK, and after reading about the challenge she decided to sign up for it. The opportunity to be able to solve real world problems in Knoxville interested her. She feels that everyone deserves a place to live. Sometimes, certain circumstances arise in people   s lives which affect their financial situations and, unfortunately, places them on the streets. Rachel would like to help the people who wind up in these situations get back up on their feet and try to give them the stability that they need to continue on with their lives. When Rachel graduates and begins her career, she hopes to impact society in a positive way with her work. The policy challenge is helping to shed light on issues that impact the entire community, directly or indirectly. This challenge is a great experience because it teaches students how to creatively tackle said issues and propose solutions to them, something which can apply directly to Rachel   s career in future years. R.J. Vogt (2nd from right, above) R.J. Vogt is a Senior in the College Scholars Program, from Franklin, TN. He aspires to write for a living. Be that magazine journalism, newspapers, books or even public relations, he believes in the strength of his writing and thinks it promotes the greatest opportunity to enact social change. Nissa approached R.J. about the policy challenge during the first weeks of school. He spends time with the homeless as he works toward his senior thesis, and felt that it was a no-brainer to join a policy team. He s been passionate about homelessness since sophomore year in high school-- and was struck by the similarities he shared with the homeless he met in Nashville. R.J. holds the perspective that he could have easily been born into similar circumstances. Homelessness is a costly fact-of-life that too many people have become accustomed to. He thinks that if America worked harder to help people find housing, our cities and country would spend less money and look less run-down. R.J. don   t know for certain that this project will directly impact his career, but believes the experience can only help him as a writer and a great communicator of original ideas. He thinks the policy challenge is a great place to start. Heather Dickson (3rd from the right, above) Heather is a Junior and Journalism and Electronic Media Major, who is originally from Washington, D.C. She is working toward a careeras a television producer of documentary and lifestyle media content. The policy challenge is a secondary project for an honors interior design course Heather is taking. She had personal interest in the topic of homelessness and alternative housing options-- and strongly believes in the influence of environment. Heather finds it challenging to overlook the issue of homelessness in Knoxville. Many parties are both directly and indirectly affected by the large concentration of homeless persons, and many resources for housing and outreach are underutilized in the community. She hope real solutions for implementation surface during this challenge. The platform of positive community alteration is a great foundation for any public career. Grasping a better understanding of the community through the issue of homelessness will translate directly to video, Heather believes. She also sees this policy challenge providing her with perspective on how to problem solve, how to capture the heart of an issue, and assist in a project with potential to have large impact in the surrounding community. Paul Attea (left, above) Paul Attea is a Senior and Architecture student, from Brentwood, TN. After graduation, he looks to take on a life of service for the disadvantaged peoples in our country. Paul discovered the Public Policy Challenge through his architecture studio instructor, Marlene Davis. Finding a solution to homelessness appeals to him because someone not having a home in the wealthiest nation in the world says more about our culture than it does these unfortunate individual, in his opinion. He believes it is a social problem that needs to be addressed by the populus and that the homeless community is one of the most vulnerable groups in our culture. Paul thinks that as human beings, anyone who is without a home is entitled to to help, especially in a nation that is as wealthy as ours. Local politics is vital to him in addressing many of the domestic issues that our nation faces. He thinks that the Public Policy Challenge will provide him with a helpful introduction into the inner workings of city government. The Challenge will be helpful in showing Paul and other students how to be a part of a solution making process through their own work and ideas.

Team Education Equality Now...  Extending the Tennessee promise to deserving non-citizen students! Pictured from left to right  Juan Quevedo, Gus White, Olivia Poston, and Brenda Adimora.   Not pictured  Kimberly Bress Tennessee currently faces the issue of whether to provide non-citizen students access to the University of Tennessee system. Currently, the University of Tennessee system (which includes UTK, UTC, and UTM) does not affirmatively admit noncitizen students. Further, Tennessee law is silent on whether noncitizen students can attend public universities. Accordingly, in Tennessee, public universities and institutions of higher education can exercise discretion regarding the admission of noncitizen students. Some of the Tennessee Board of Regents universities, the counterpart to the University of Tennessee system, have made an intentional policy decision to admit non-citizen students. The University of Tennessee, however, blatantly denies college admission to non-citizen students. For example, some university officials have said    if a person   s presence in this country is not legal, then it would make no sense to admit that person to college.    This dual system is troubling because the University of Tennessee system offers college admission to some, and not to others, solely on the basis of immigration status, or lack thereof. A uniform policy must be implemented throughout the state. This disparate policy essentially relegates non-citizen students to remain in a lower socio-economic status through denying access to the system of higher education in a state where many non-citizen students have resided most of their lives. This issue can, and should, be solved by local or state policymakers.    Juan Quevedo is a second year law student at the University of Tennessee.

Benefits of smart grid using Fiber Optic Network includes  a constant communication when distributing power and allowing greater efficiency for measuring demand, managing demand, giving consumers and business an incentive to grow, an affordable high capacity data network, and reliable uninterrupted power distribution service. Our neighboring city, Chattanooga, already implemented a smart grid and is now the leading in internet service provider speeds and affordability in the State of Tennessee and the nation. This is only a side effect of their smart grid movement. According to a study done by University of California Berkley, there is an $80 billion loss to the USA, for power outages. Chattanooga   s Electric Power Board calculated this to be $100 Million for their city  more so, recuperated $40 million by installing the new smart grid. Making this a movement for Knoxville and Tennessee can vastly improve the quality of services provided to citizens and businesses.

Dr. Ando described her talks as follows  Climate change is likely to alter the spatial distributions of species and habitat types but the nature of such change is uncertain. Thus, climate change makes it difficult to implement standard conservation planning paradigms. Previous work has suggested some approaches to cope with such uncertainty but has not harnessed all of the benefits of risk diversification. We adapt Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) to optimal spatial targeting of conservation activity, using wetland habitat conservation in the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) as an example. This approach finds the allocations of conservation activity among sub-regions of the planning area that maximize the expected conservation returns for a given level of uncertainty or minimize uncertainty for a given expected level of returns. We find that using MPT instead of simple diversification in the PPR can achieve a value of the conservation objective per dollar spent that is 15% higher for the same level of risk. MPT-based portfolios can also have 21% less uncertainty over benefits or 6% greater expected benefits than the current portfolio of PPR conservation. Total benefits from conservation investment are higher if returns are defined in terms of benefit   cost ratios rather than benefits alone. MPT-guided diversification can work to reduce the climate-change induced uncertainty of future ecosystem-service benefits from many land policy and investment initiatives, especially when outcomes are negatively correlated between sub-regions of a planning area.

However, in 1980, Congress amended the 1974 Federal Act, allowing the dentition of status offenders if a valid court order has been put in place. The valid court order  exception permits jailing as a last resort to try to control status offenders who pleaded guilty and violated instructions from the court. Truancy is a status offense in Tennessee which has gained national attention over the past several years. The law in Tennessee allows for students to be declared    truant    if they miss school more than five times in a single school-year. The Advocates will focus on the growing issue of accused truants and issues surrounding status offenders    rights to legal counsel. The Advocates will research case studies, examine Tennessee statues, and interview community leaders and advocates to create solutions to combat youth incarceration amongst status offenders.   MEGHAN TREECE   is a fourth year undergraduate student majoring in Political Science and Sociology at the University of Tennessee. Upon obtaining her bachelor   s degree, Meghan hopes to attend law school. Meghan has a strong interest in the juvenile justice system, which is why she chose to focus on this  topic for the Howard Baker Public Policy Challenge. FOLASADE OMOGUN  is a second year law student at the University Of Tennessee College Of Law. In 2011, she graduated from Clark Atlanta University with a bachelors in Journalism and History.   Last summer, Folasade clerked at the Public Defender Service for the District of Columbia where she represented clients who were facing a revocation of their parole before the United States Parole Commission.   Folasade currently serves as a 2L Coordinator for UT   s Voters Restoration Pro Bono Project, a member of the Frederick Douglass Moot Court Team, and Legal Research Assistant to law school Professor Judy Cornett. Folasade   s policy interests are related to the Sixth Amendment and the accused rights to the assistance of counsel, employment, poverty, and state and local issues. Folasade chose to focus her research on creating solutions to combat the dentition of status offenders in Tennessee. MARRIAH PAIGE   is a second year law student at the University of Tennessee College of Law who is passionate about dismantling the school to prison pipeline.   Her interest in civil and human rights continued in her studies at the University of Georgia (UGA), where she double majored in Communication Studies and Sociology. During her Senior year, Marriah completed a directed study under Josiah Meigs Distinguished Professor, Dr. Tina Harris where she assisted in a research project on the topics of race, communication, and social media sites.

Note    The Alumni Spotlight was created to recognize the exceptional achievements of our Baker Center student alumni as they scatter across the globe to pursue their diverse interests. Lindsay McClain Opiyo Perhaps no alum has traveled farther than the subject of our inaugural Alumni Spotlight, Lindsay McClain. Married and living in Gulu, Uganda, she works as both the Gender Justice Team Leader at Justice and Reconciliation Project (JRP) and as the Coordinator for the Everyday Peace Indicators (EPI) Project, which is pioneering a new methodology for measuring peace indicators that documents and surveys community perceptions of peace and safety to chart change over time. Although Lindsay has traveled far since graduating from UT, it was not unexpected to anyone who knew her during her undergraduate career. Lindsay first traveled to East and Southern Africa the summer after her freshman year at UT with Dr. Rosalind I.J. Hackett of the UT Religious Studies Department. It was Dr. Hackett who suggested applying for the Baker Scholars program to Lindsay, and she later served as the mentor for Lindsay   s Baker Scholars and College Scholars thesis project, which focused on the arts and peacebuilding in Africa. With the support of and mentorship of the Baker Center and a variety of other programs and centers at UT, Lindsay was able to travel to Uganda four times in her undergraduate career to conduct primary research and to intern for a semester in Washington, DC at the Enough Project, an initiative that is based at the Center for American Progress and works to end crimes against humanity and genocide through US policy intervention.   Between her extensive traveling and work off-campus, Lindsay could often be found at the Baker Center, where she worked as an archivist in the Modern Political Archives. After graduating from UT in December 2009, Lindsay relocated to Gulu, Uganda where she began working for JRP, as well as serving as the local coordinator for UT   s Gulu Study and Service Abroad Program. In 2010, she co-founded Music for Peace (MfP) with two northern Ugandan artists. MfP is a community-based organization that promotes the power of music for peace building and social change. Lindsay (kneeling in white tank top and boots) is pictured with the group.  From 2012 to 2014, Lindsay attended the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies at the University of Notre Dame and earned a Master   s degree in Peace Studies in May 2014. This summer, Lindsay returned to Uganda to pursue her current work with JRP and EPI. Lindsay remains passionate about work that empowers conflict survivors and local communities to be their own advocates for peace, justice, and reconciliation. Lindsay   s advice to current Baker Students    Find mentors on campus. I met Dr. Hackett during my freshman year at UT, and Dr. Tricia Redeker Hepner shortly thereafter. Both have remained a big part of my life. Dr. Hackett even served as my witness during my wedding in Uganda in 2012 and Dr. Hepner attended. My experience at UT and my life post-graduation would not be the same without them. They have been instrumental in my professional and personal development, recommending me for employment and scholarships, guiding me as I make decisions on my career and providing a wealth of knowledge on peacebuilding in Africa. As a second piece of advice, spend at least one semester off campus, preferably doing service learning or something to further your professional development. It is very valuable to be able to compare and contrast what you   re learning in the classroom with what you will find in the workplace later. This will also help you narrow down what you really want to do, build your network and hopefully find rewarding work after graduation.","link":"http:\/\/bakercenter.utk.edu\/alumni-spotlight-lindsay-mcclain-opiyo-baker-scholar-2008-09\/"},{"title":"The Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Clean Power Plan","content":"The Environmental Protection Agency   s Clean Power Plan The Bredesen Center for Interdisciplinary Research and Graduate Education at the University of Tennessee supports the Environmental Protection Agency   s actions to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from currently operating electricity generating facilities. Carbon dioxide emissions could have a variety of considerable negative impacts to our nation, including global climate change. Regulating carbon emissions from the electric power industry is an effective way of reducing the nation   s contribution to this effect. The Bredesen Center has uncovered inconsistencies in the Clean Power Plan and its application to existing power plants. The identified inconsistencies have been shown to have negative implications on existing facilities. The Bredesen Center urges the Environmental Protection Agency to correct these inconsistencies and instead apply technology-neutral regulations on carbon emissions to all states in order to allow industry to employ a free market approach. A technology-neutral regulation methodology will provide both an accurate picture of the emission goals and the freedom for states to reach these goals in a manner most appropriate for their circumstance. This increased accuracy and freedom is more politically viable and therefore more likely to reach the emission reduction goals initially set forth by the Clean Power Plan.

Baker Jr. Center for Public Policy at the University of Tennessee and the Sparks Bureau  of Business and Economic Research at the University of Memphis to       perform a study on the  economic feasibility of creating and utilizing a statewide comprehensive energy plan. The study  shall examine the state   s current and future energy supply and demand needs, existing energy  policies, and emerging energy challenges and opportunities.    This report is their  collective effort to  fulfill this legislative mandate.  In addressing  the  charge from the General Assembly, the team  placed heavy emphasis on providing  background data and information to inform the public and policymakers.  They  sought to provide a resource that will be of lasting value to those who are interested in state energy  issues. The    goal is to provide stakeholders with a better understanding of Tennessee   s energy  sector and how it fits within the context of regional, national and global markets and policy  influences. It is essential that public policy be built on a common foundation of information and  knowledge to ensure stakeholder support and policy efficacy.","link":"http:\/\/bakercenter.utk.edu\/a-profile-of-the-energy-sector-in-tennessee\/"},{"title":"LaRiviere Awarded $150,000 for Study from UT Battelle","content":"LaRiviere Awarded $150,000 for Study from UT Battelle Dr. Jacob LaRiviere, UT Baker Fellow and Economics professor, recently won a $150,000 competitively awarded subcontract from UT-Battelle.

This talk considers how prominent goals of natural resources law and the prevailing model of regulatory decision making combine to limit the capacity of natural resources governance to manage the effects of climate change.   It will also explore the implications of continuing to rely on conventionally static and fragmented decision making, passive management, and historical preservation when global climatic shifts are widely expected to lead to rapid changes in ecological systems that are unforeseen, novel, and potentially detrimental to ecological diversity and function. This emphasis of natural resources management on stasis arises from the legal system   s discomfort with integrating and managing uncertainty and change. As an accelerant, climate change makes this rigidity particularly evident and unsustainable. Arguments for the need to change both the means and the ends of natural resources law to better deal with change and uncertainty, as well as inform and galvanize public deliberation on natural resource decisions will be considered.

The complete publication can be found here    White Paper.DLG.alternative transp. 1 15 Abstract    Lack of adequate refueling infrastructure is a major barrier to the success of alternative  motor fuels. A transition from fossil petroleum to alternative, low-carbon transportation  fuels appears to be necessary to mitigate the adverse impacts of global warming,  strengthen energy security and meet air quality standards. Finding effective  combinations of business models and public policies to accomplish a transition to  alternative fuels poses a new and difficult challenge. Focusing on highway vehicles, this  paper reviews the motivation for transition to alternative fuels, the current status of  alternative fuel refueling infrastructure in the U.S., the costs of such infrastructure and  business models and policies that have been proposed to achieve a successful transition. The goal of this paper is to serve as a basis for innovative thinking and  discussion rather than as a comprehensive analysis of the issue. Infrastructure for  producing and delivering fuels to refueling stations is equally important but is outside the scope of this paper.","link":"http:\/\/bakercenter.utk.edu\/alternative-transportation-refueling-infrastructure-in-the-us-2014-status-and-challenges\/"},{"title":"Ashe Lecture &#8211; April 7 @ 5:30 pm &#8211; Ambassador Humaina Al-Mughairy","content":"Ashe Lecture     April 7 @ 5 30 pm     Ambassador Humaina Al-Mughairy Her Excellency Hunaina Sultan Ahmed Al-Mughairy, Ambassador Extraordinary & Plenipotentiary, will present a lecture on   Oman   US Relations.

First, we developed a multi-species model of Chesapeake Bay fisheries to forecast the impacts of the TMDL on harvested fish and shellfish stocks in the bay and connected Atlantic coast waters. Next, we examined the potential producer and consumer surplus changes using a traditional Shafer-logistic model under three alternative assumptions about the management regime in each fishery  fixed effort, open access, and maximum sustainable surplus. In the special case of an open access fishery, we also examined the implications of failure of the exogeneity assumptions often used to estimate consumer demand elasticities for fish and shellfish. We show that an unbiased estimate of the demand elasticity can be obtained, without recourse to an instrumental variables estimator, by exploiting the structural assumptions underlying the nature of the simultaneous determination of price and quantity under open access.

In light of the recent annexation of Ukrainian territory by Russia and the persistent fear that the conflict will escalate, the Howard H. Baker Jr. Center for Public Policy and the Department of Political Science at the University of Tennessee are hosting this  two-day workshop and preceding public forum. This forum  will kickoff a workshop on June 5-6  focused on the topic--  New Directions in the Study of Territory and Political Violence - Advancing Theory, Methods & Data Collection.  The workshop will bring together scholars from across the country who  research the conditions associated with political violence, how issues such as territory factor into leaders  decisions during crises, the geo-spatial environments accompanying insurgency, civil war, democratization, and the effects of issue salience on leader bargaining.   This program was designed in response to the recent conflict over Crimea and Eastern Ukraine.   It illustrates the importance of these issues in world politics. The    bones of contention    between Kiev and Moscow are not simply the abstract concepts of power and security, but importantly relate to specific disagreements over territorial possessions and economic instability. Crimea serves as a critical military installation for the Russian Navy and efforts to foment political unrest in Ukraine by Russian authorities may reflect an attempt to derail economic ties with the EU so as to inhibit goods from Europe evading Russian tariffs.

Tennessee   s advanced energy sector is a lucrative growth sector and a source of high quality jobs, according the Tennessee Advanced Energy Economic Impact Report, released today by the Tennessee Advanced Energy Business Council (TAEBC). TAEBC is a new organization that champions advanced energy as an economic development and job creation strategy. The report is the first document of its kind that defines the scope and scale of Tennessee   s advanced energy sector and quantifies its economic impact. It identifies the number of jobs, contribution to state GDP and state local taxes and number of companies associated with the state   s advanced energy sector.    Because advanced energy is a relatively new and emerging industry, there was no comprehensive inventory of the economic activity that falls under the advanced energy umbrella for Tennessee - until now,    said Tom Ballard, President of TAEBC and Chief Alliance Officer at Pershing Yoakley & Associates.    The report shows that Tennessee is a national and international leader in this rapidly growing, $1.3 trillion global marketplace.    Key findings from the report include  Advanced energy is a rapidly expanding and lucrative growth sector in Tennessee. Nearly 325,000 jobs are supported by 17,334 firms in the state   s advanced energy sector in 2013. Advanced energy requires skilled labor and thus is a source of high quality jobs in Tennessee. The annual average wage of a worker in advanced energy was $48,764, which is well above the state average. Advanced energy provides a home for our emerging workforce as we drive to get 55 percent of Tennesseans equipped with a college degree or certificate by 2025. Tennessee manufacturers benefit from a robust advanced energy sector. Especially Tennessee   s automotive manufacturers that are integrating advanced energy technologies into their processes and products as a result of higher fuel economy standards. Automakers must reach a fleet average of 54.5 MPG by 2025. Advanced energy contributes significantly to our state and local economies. Tennessee   s advanced energy sector contributes $33.4 billion to state gross domestic product, while workers in the advanced energy sector pay more than $820 million in sales tax to state and local governments. Advanced energy represents an opportunity to promote rural economic development. Currently, almost 80 percent of advanced energy activity is centered in just 20 counties in Tennessee. Davidson County leads Tennessee   s advanced energy economy. Rural Tennessee could benefit from further growth in advanced energy activity. Tennessee is not the only state vying for a piece of the advanced energy economy. Highlighting our assets and opportunities will provide Tennessee with a competitive edge in the recruitment and retention of the advanced energy sector. Approximately 11 states including Arkansas, North Carolina, South Carolina and Florida are benchmarking and tracking their advanced energy economies.    Advanced energy    is defined as any technology that makes energy cleaner, safer, more secure and more efficient. Rather than favoring specific technologies, advanced energy is technology neutral. Examples include electric and plug-in hybrid cars, lightweight composites for the automotive industry, natural gas fueled trucks, pollution control equipment, bio energy, high-performance buildings, more efficient industrial processes, power reliability, smart grids, combined heat and power and the latest power generation technologies. The report identified 62, four-digit NAIC codes and County Business Pattern data to provide the most granular information about the state   s advanced energy economy from 2013. Included in the report are advanced energy economic impact data by metro area including  Nashville, Memphis, Clarksville, Knoxville Oak Ridge, Tri-Cities, Chattanooga, Jackson and others. Advanced energy business leaders from across the state discussed the economic impact of advanced energy in Tennessee during a press conference call to release the report findings. Representatives from Schneider Electric, Oak Ridge National Lab, Renewable Algal Energy, Memphis Bioworks Foundation and Signal Energy Constructors highlighted how their companies are engaged in this $1.3 trillion global market.    The global energy sector is changing rapidly and these changes are rippling through all sectors of the economy in increasingly visible ways,    said Jim Plourde, National Business Development Manager with Schneider Electric and TAEBC board member. Schneider Electric employs approximately 1,500 people in Middle Tennessee, focused on energy engineering, product development, manufacturing and global business management.  Schneider Electric has seized these global market opportunities through continuous innovation in solutions built on the pillars of energy efficiency, reliability, security, and safety,    added Plourde. Research for the Tennessee Advanced Energy Economic Impact Report was conducted by The Howard H. Baker Jr. Center for Public Policy and funded by the University of Tennessee   s TN-SCORE initiative, The Energy Foundation and members of the Tennessee Advanced Energy Business Council.

The Urban Wilderness trail system in South Knoxville is a valuable natural asset that generates local spending and tax revenues, supports jobs, helps Knoxville attract and retain a highly skilled workforce and helps enhance resident   s quality of life. For purposes of policy, planning, and local pride, it is important for residents to understand the nature of these benefits. Quantifying these values is challenging but necessary in order to determine the impact of public and private activities that may enhance or diminish this asset. This report provides estimates of the potential economic impact of the trail system on a three county region  Knox, Anderson, and Grainger Counties. Using existing studies of other trail systems in the United States, the study identifies three potential future growth scenarios for the trail system. Each scenario implies a different level of bike-related trail use and visitor expenditure. These estimates of trail use and expenditure at other trail areas are combined with characteristics of the local population and economy to provide forecasts of the economic impact potential of the trail system in terms of direct spending, indirect induced spending, and sales tax revenues. While useful, these estimates do not consider many other benefits of the trail system including employment impacts, job recruitment, trail proximity impacts on property values, and overall quality of life.

Grounded in data and analytic models, an IRP process focuses on future energy demand and resources. It cannot and should not try to answer the urgent policy questions facing electric utilities today. More is needed. This policy brief reviews the 30-year evolution of IRP and lists five factors that are radically altering the US electricity industry. Three of these factors     uncertainties surrounding energy resource costs, electricity demand, and climate change effects     can with difficulty be digested by today   s sophisticated IRP models. But the other two factors cannot. New players, together with new public policies, have been game changers. They have raised fundamental questions such as How should distributed energy developers and users be integrated into the electricity scene? How should the economic burdens of    stranded    utility assets be allocated? Who should ensure grid reliability? Who, if anyone, should make sure that everyone can afford    basic needs    electricity? To address these and other questions, a companion process is needed. This process should be tailored to the utility, its regulatory setting, and the issues at hand. Most crucially, it should foster open deliberation.

This paper lays out his  long view   of the  debate beginning with a statement by another philosophy professor, Dr.  Paul B. Thompson.   Writing in the early 1980s, Thompson elegantly summarized the debate over nuclear power  proponents argue that it is both necessary and safe, opponents argue that it is neither, and each group rejects virtually every substantive premise of the other (1984  57-8). Over three decades later, that summary remains largely accurate. Nuclear power is necessary, say its proponents, because demand for electricity is increasing, especially in developing nations. Ian Hore-Lacy, writing for the nuclear industry, contends that    One-third of the world   s population does not have access to electricity supply, and a further third does not enjoy reliable supply. There is a huge need to address these shortcomings and expectations    (2012  8). Fossil fuels cannot meet this need, proponents say, because their reserves are dwindling, their cost is increasing, and they are the primary sources of climate change. Renewable energy sources, such as wind and sunlight, are available only intermittently   and, say nuclear proponents, they cannot be scaled up fast enough to meet the challenge of climate change. Energy efficiency is not a solution, since it decreases energy costs and hence encourages more consumption. It is, moreover, unrealistic to expect consumption to decrease (Hore-Lacy 2012  9). There is thus, according to nuclear proponents, no prospect of meeting growing global demand, addressing climate change, and reducing world poverty without nuclear power. This argument is forceful. If foregoing nuclear power would indeed condemn large swaths of humanity to poverty, long-term climate change, or both, then necessity trumps safety, and proponents prevail on grounds of necessity alone.

He will speak on  Fossil Fuels and Climate    Humankind   s Faustian Bargain. Environmental concerns today are similar and different from those that catalyzed the first Earth Day more than 45 years ago. Water pollution and air pollution led the list then, followed by loss of habitat and perhaps species, the concerns were local to regional. Today, in many parts of the world, there are similar place-based concerns  shortages of clean and accessible freshwater, health threatening changes in the chemistry of the atmosphere, severe degradation of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, increases in soil erosion, loss of biodiversity, alterations of the coastal zone, and declines in fisheries. We now know that human activity has altered significantly the fundamental biogeochemical cycle and the planetary carbon cycle with atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide  (CO2) and methane (CH4) moving into a range unprecedented in human experience. The issues are complex and compelling  What do we know? What do we think we know?  What do we not know? What should we do? What should we not do? How do we undo this Faustian bargain?

Baker Jr. Center for Public Policy at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, has been selected as a partner in the U.S. Department of State s Diplomacy Lab program, which harnesses the knowledge of students and faculty at universities across the country to study issues of worldwide importance. The Diplomacy Lab helps the State Department broaden its research base and more effectively respond to a variety of global challenges.  The Diplomacy Lab is a unique opportunity for our students and faculty to contribute directly to the policy-making process,  said Matt Murray, director of the Baker Center.  Our students will engage with the State Department throughout the fall semester through videos and teleconferences while our faculty members serve as mentors to them during the research process.  A standard Diplomacy Lab team is a group of at least four undergraduate or graduate students in any discipline led by a faculty member. Over the course of a semester, professors will guide their students in developing a final product for the State Department. Teams will have a conference session with State Department officials to get more direction as they begin the project. They ll meet again midcourse and then have a final conference where they will present their results, which could take the form of policy memos, longer research papers, statistical analyses, interactive media or data sets. The Baker Center   on behalf of UT faculty   submitted four proposals to the State Department, responding to the problems provided by the State Department. The following three projects were selected to participate in the Diplomacy Lab   caption id= attachment_8572  align= alignright  width= 300   Bharat Mehra leads a conference call with the State Department and graduate students to discuss international corrections reform and human rights protections.  caption   International Correction Reform and Human Rights Protections for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Intersex Inmates in Latin America and or Africa    Bharat Mehra, associate professor in the School of Information Sciences, will work with a group of graduate students to look at the treatment of those imprisoned for being or perceived to be LGBTI in selected countries of South American and Africa, especially those whose laws that criminalize an already marginalized population.  It is a great opportunity to make a difference by developing practical research applications, information and technology use, and GIS maps to represent current trends, baseline protections and best practices that support the government in making life better for such a marginalized population,  Mehra said.  Case Studies of Communication Strategies Tactics of Police Units in Democracies    Catherine Luther, professor of journalism and electronic media in the College of Communications and Information Sciences, and an ethnically diverse group of graduate students will examine how law enforcement representatives in selected democracies engage with their communities and suggest how improvements might be made via new media. Case studies will be conducted on four police units  Delhi Police (India), Belgrade Police (Serbia), Seoul Metropolitan Police (South Korea), and Atlanta Police (U.S.).  The Diplomacy Lab will allow my students to engage in experiential learning and possibly make valuable professional connections,  Luther said.  The project s subject matter will let me share with my students the insights that I have gained in my recent research pertaining to digital media and security issues.   caption id= attachment_8573  align= alignright  width= 300   Krista E. Wiegand leads a video conference between graduate students and the State Department to discuss insurgencies, separatist movements and civil wars.  caption   Evaluating Diplomatic Intervention in International Conflicts    Krista E. Wiegand, a Baker Faculty Fellow and associate professor in the Department of Political Science, will work with graduate students from political science and the Master of Public Policy and Administration program to study ethnic, religious, tribal and linguistic insurgencies, secession and separatist movements, and civil wars. They will use the Uppsala Department of Peace and Conflict Research Peace Agreement Dataset, which records all peace agreements, partial and completed, from 1973 through 2011, to analyze how political violence ends and what impact elections have on ending political violence.  This is a really unique opportunity for my international conflict class to interact directly with representatives of the Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations at the Department of State,  Wiegand said.  For them to be able to contribute analysis on diplomatic interventions in international conflicts and to learn how the real world of diplomacy works is remarkable.   I am so excited about the potential of the Diplomacy Lab,  said Nissa Dahlin-Brown, associate director of the Baker Center and director of the Diplomacy Lab program.  What an honor for our students and faculty to have this experience working on a team with the Department of State, critically analyzing issues and helping inform policymakers around the world. It will be fascinating to see the results in December.

She will speak on Crossroads of Science, Society, Nature  Mbaracay   Biosphere Reserve, Paraguay. Like most nations in South America, Paraguay is faced with a number of environmental challenges. Both of its major biomes (Chaco, Interior Atlantic Forest) are currently undergoing rapid anthropogenic land cover change.   Much of this change stems from increasing internal economic and population pressure.   Since the implementation of democratic reforms in 1989, rapid social and economic changes have occurred in Paraguay.   These social changes are reflected in land use change, particularly deforestation and conversion of land from native cover to pasture and crop land. Here we examine the potential consequences of these landscape transformations for outbreaks of emerging pathogens and human health. We illustrate by focusing in particular on the area surrounding the Mbaracay   Biosphere Reserve, the largest remaining fragment and the largest protected area of the Interior Atlantic Forest ecoregion in Paraguay. In the 1990s, Paraguay experienced an outbreak of hantavirus, and hantaviruses have subsequently been shown to be endemic to the area. Land use changes impact the composition of the rodent community that carries hantaviruses, and we have found, for example, that rodents that have been exposed to hantaviruses occur in disproportionately high frequency in parts of the landscape transformed by human impacts. These results suggest important connections between land use patterns and the potential for future outbreaks of emerging pathogens. Join us - free & open to the public!

There has always been a known gap between the test ratings and what people get in the real world, which historically has been about a 15 percent difference,  said David Greene, one of the authors of the study and senior fellow in the Energy and Environmental Policy program at UT s Baker Center.  But one of the key findings in our study is that we found this difference has recently increased to about 20 percent. An increase of this size was anticipated by the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Transportation when they set the new fuel economy standards. The real issue is to be sure the gap doesn   t continue to grow.  The fuel economy tests are used for two purposes  to determine if manufacturers are in compliance with federal fuel economy and greenhouse gas emission standards, and to inform the public about the fuel economy of the vehicles they buy. With respect to consumer information, Greene says there have always been differences between what people get on average and what number is reflected on the label of a new car. But the study found tremendous variability from driver to driver. Because of that, the label value is not a good predictor of what individuals will actually get, which makes the information less useful to consumers. Researchers analyzed approximately 75,000 individual fuel economy estimates from the Department of Energy s website, http   www.fueleconomy.gov. Visitors to the website have been submitting their own fuel economy estimates since 2005. The records cover all model years from 1984 to 2015 and all states in the U.S.  This is a unique resource for understanding how fuel economy estimates used to enforce corporate average fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions standards relate to real-world outcomes,  said Greene. Greene said technology exists to give drivers more accurate data that correlates with their driving habits and travel routines.  For years, people have assumed that the problem with the government s fuel economy estimates was that they were too high, on average,  said Greene.  But according to the data, the EPA miles-per-gallon numbers do a pretty good job of predicting what the average driver will get. The problem is that very few of us are average. For a car rated 25 miles per gallon, we can be 95 percent sure that the on-road fuel economy any individual driver actually gets will be somewhere between 15 and 35. Consumers need better information than that, and modern information technology may make that possible.  The findings show that the shortfall between test cycle fuel economy estimates and in-use fuel economy estimates has been increasing since 2005. According to Greene, the gap should be closely monitored and, if it continues to grow, test procedures or regulations should be adapted to better reflect real-world conditions.  Manufacturers will spend billions of dollars each year to meet federal fuel economy and emissions standards,  said Greene.  The standards are designed to save consumers several times that in reduced fuel costs. Making sure the standards are working as intended requires knowing what drivers really get on the road. Now it s more important than ever that we watch this closely to make sure the gap doesn t get any bigger.

Dr. Perrings will discuss how   international trade travel is widely seen as a source of infectious disease risks to humans, animals, and plants.   Most emerging zoonotic and epizootic diseases have their origins in low-income tropical countries and are spread internationally through trade. The international trade regime includes disease risk management measures and institutions that frame the actions that may be taken to counter specific disease risks as they arise. Regional trade agreements frequently include an environmental element. This often standardizes sanitary and phytosanitary controls on trade among parties to the agreement.   He considers the disease risk impacts of changes in sanitary and phytosanitary controls on internationally traded goods, using a continuum-of-goods Ricardian trade model of the kind developed by Dornbusch, Fischer, and Samuelson.

Congratulations to Professor Brotman and Professor Tonn! About Diplomacy Lab The University of Tennessee, through the Howard H. Baker Jr. Center for Public Policy, has been a partner in the U.S. Department of State   s Diplomacy Lab since fall 2015 semester.   The program enables the Department of State to    course-source    research and innovation related to foreign policy by harnessing the efforts of students and faculty at universities across the country. Each semester, the Department of State sends out a list of proposed projects to participating universities.   Currently, 28 universities participate in the program.   Universities bid on specific project proposals.   Guided by a faculty member with expertise in the area of interest, selected teams or classes get to explore real-world challenges, engage with State Department officials and produce a final product that accomplishes goals identified by the Department of State.   It is a great opportunity for experiential learning and enables students to contribute to the policymaking process.   To date, a total of eleven projects at UT have been selected to participate in the program since its inception.

Roadway quality is now at risk unless new funding is found. That s the finding reported in a new paper produced by researchers at the Howard H. Baker Jr. Center for Public Policy at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.  The  policy brief is available here    PolicyBrief-4-15-Gas.11.24.15 UT Baker Center researchers, Dr. Mark Burton, Dr. David Greene and Dr. Matt Murray, collaborated to recommend a policy for maintaining and improving roads in light of declining gas tax revenues.   The decline in revenue is mainly due to inflation (gas tax has not been increased since  1989 when gas cost around $1 gallon)  and the  improving gas efficiency of cars.   The authors recommend a combination of raising the tax and indexing it to inflation and efficiency.","link":"http:\/\/bakercenter.utk.edu\/future-of-roadway-funding-in-tennessee-policy-brief-nov-24-2015\/"},{"title":"Brandon Prins","content":"Brandon Prins Curriculum Vitae Dr. Prins specializes in international conflict processes.

These reports were prepared for UCOR URS   CH2M Oak Ridge LLC. The Department of Energy   s Oak Ridge Office of Environmental Management (DOE-OREM) is responsible for significant economic impact in the state of Tennessee, and more specifically in Anderson, Roane, and Knox Counties.   The impacts are measured in terms of jobs and income created for area residents, as well as tax revenues generated for state and local governments.   The Howard H. Baker Jr. Center for Public Policy conducted this study to identify the primary economic impact derived from DOE-OREM   s programs for Tennessee and the three-county region during fiscal year 2014 (FY2014).     The study confirms substantial economic impacts from DOE-OREM   s activities. The Department of Energy   s Oak Ridge Office of Environmental Management (DOE-OREM) is evaluating whether to construct a new on-site disposal facility to facilitate continued cleanup activities on the Oak Ridge Reservation. Design, construction and subsequent operation of the new waste disposal facility will have a significant impact on both the regional and state economies. While the impacts will be concentrated in the Anderson, Roane, and Knox counties region, equipment rental, materials acquisition, and payroll spending will create economic ripples that will extend into other Tennessee communities. The analysis focuses on related activities, as forecasted in the draft Remedial Investigation Feasibility Study for Oak Ridge Reservation waste disposal, from 2012 to 2047, when cleanup of the Oak Ridge Reservation will be complete. However, this analysis extends through 2055 to include the first eight years of postclosure monitoring and maintenance at the facility. Projected economic impacts of the environmental cleanup program that account for the design, construction, operation and closure of a new on-site disposal facility include a significant increase in state output or state gross domestic product (state GDP), personal income (which accrues to residents of the state), sales and use tax revenue, and employment for the duration of the project. Expenditures incurred to support construction, materials and equipment procurement, and overhead will lead to dispersion of these impacts across a significant portion of the state economy. Highly-skilled management, engineers, operators, laborers, foremen, security, and professional employees of DOE-OREM and its contractors will spend disposable income in a manner that will create additional jobs and income. The same will be true of workers employed by vendors supplying materials and equipment. Increased business activity and worker spending will boost sales and use tax revenues for state and local governments. The reports can be found here  OREMPart1Final and OREMPart2Final.

The SSDP UTK team is working on proposing a city ordinance that would permit clean  needle exchanges to take place in the Nashville Metropolitan area in an attempt to  reduce HIV and Hepatitis C transmission. Because needles are considered  paraphernalia in the state of Tennessee, the ordinance will challenge Tennessee Code   39-17-425  and begin the process of augmenting the state   s current prohibition of  needle exchange clinics around the state. Federal law continues to ban the funding of  needles for exchange programs, but in early 2016 in the federal omnibus spending bill  permitted funds to be allocated towards staffing costs and other expenses affiliated with  the needle exchange programs. Although funds will likely not be allocated by the city of  Nashville for the purchase of clean needles at the inception of the program, other harm  reduction groups around the country cover the costs by donations and exterior grant  funding. The team is asking for public input in the development of their plan for clean  needle exchange in Nashville. Many of the ideas and policy provisions are coming from previously implemented programs in Kentucky and suggestions developed by the North Carolina Harm Reduction Coalition. Members of the team include Miranda Gottlieb, Christina Gore, Austin Eddy, Will Gabelman and Thomas Carpenter. Backgrounds include Political Science, Economic, Environmental Studies, and Classics.

The  Feed the Gardens, Feed the Kids  policy team is made up of three graduate students from the Department of Nutrition, Alexandra Alford, Lauren Woods, and Marissa McElrone. The team is working on a policy brief that  combats the educational and resource waste often seen in Knox County school and community gardens in the summer months.  Urban agriculture supports several community gardens in Knoxville, Tennessee. These initiatives provide additional food security and nutrition education opportunities for students and community members. Unfortunately, many gardens are left unattended while the students are on summer break because they are associated with school and after school programs. To combat this educational and resource waste, we propose a policy to align Summer Feeding Programs with schools and community gardens. This policy promotes additional food security and opportunities for nutrition education, while ensuring the sustainability of the school and community gardens during summer months.","link":"http:\/\/bakercenter.utk.edu\/policy-challenge-blog-feed-the-gardens-feed-the-kids-policy-group\/"},{"title":"Energy Intensity and Electricity Consumption in Tennessee","content":"Energy Intensity and Electricity Consumption in Tennessee J. Scott Holladay, UT professor of Economics and Baker Fellow in Energy & Environment and Rebecca J. Davis, Graduate Research Assistant in Economics research how the state of Tennessee   s electricity consumption grew steadily for decades as the state   s population and economy grew, but electricity consumption has now leveled off. While the state   s population and economy have continued to grow, electricity demand has been flat since the onset of the Great Recession in 2007. In this policy brief they argue that Tennessee   s economy has entered a new era of reduced electricity intensity. They define electricity intensity as electricity demand per person or dollar of economic activity. They argue that falling electricity intensity is driven largely by increased energy efficiency. Increases in efficiency across industrial, commercial and household sectors have arrested the growth in electricity consumption. For the first time, electricity consumption has been decoupled from economic and population growth.

This policy brief focuses on the recent initiative by the Student Government Association (SGA) to implement the Real Food Challenge (RFC) on The University of Tennessee   s campus. This initiative aims to increase healthy food availability on campus. The RFC is a national, grant-funded initiative that provides support and resources to college campuses interested in providing their students with better food options.    Real food    is defined in this context as    local community-based, fair, ecologically sound, and humane    and incorporates a food system approach by including farmers and farm laborers, use of natural resources, access to healthy foods, and fair prices. Specifically, SGA has requested a commitment for 20% of campus food resources to be    real food    by 2020. Despite a massive campaign and ample student interest in the form of signed petitions to implement the RFC, SGA is having a hard time convincing Aramark and University administration to participate. This may be due to the fact that a majority of the action would fall on these stakeholders, rather than the students, with the feasibility of a large campaign being questionable. In our policy brief, we are looking at multiple potential policy options to increase healthy food availability on UTK   s campus. Particularly, we hope to spark a compromise between the dining representatives, the students, and the administration, to come up with a policy that would be mutually beneficial without inducing excess burden on any of the involved parties. To accomplish this, we have spoken with representatives from SGA and Aramark to determine their positions on the issue. Currently, we are exploring the option of a sustainable    Farm-to-College    program that would allow for feasible increases in local food purchases.","link":"http:\/\/bakercenter.utk.edu\/policy-challenge-blog-farm-to-utk\/"},{"title":"Policy Challenge Blog: Crime and Incarceration","content":"Policy Challenge Blog  Crime and Incarceration Human slavery is typically thought to be a thing of the past, but today human traffickers are generating billions of dollars of profit through the exploitation of people, including here in the U.S. It is estimated by the International Labour Organization that there are 20.9 million people enslaved around the world today.  Human trafficking involves the illegal trading of people, typically as forced labor and sexual exploitation. Our group wants to increase awareness and education about human trafficking within the United States and across Tennessee through  the  development of a public service announcement.  Providing the public with the knowledge and tools to aid law enforcement officials with their investigation of possible trafficking situations is essential for combating inefficiency.","link":"http:\/\/bakercenter.utk.edu\/10685-2\/"},{"title":"Policy Challenge Blog: Health and Wellness Group A","content":"Policy Challenge Blog  Health and Wellness Group A Maternal substance abuse has become a serious issue for Tennessee, and has  resulted in negative health outcomes, including increased incidences of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). NAS is a withdrawal syndrome experienced by    drug-dependent    infants shortly after birth. Opiate abuse and NAS births are public health issues posing significant pecuniary and nonpecuniary costs, and these issues presents significant challenges for policymakers and key stakeholders. From 2003 to 2014, the frequency of NAS births in Tennessee increased 15-fold, with 973 NAS births in 2014, while the national average only grew 3-fold. To reduce NAS incidences, our policy aims to  (1) establish incentives increase enrollment in prenatal care for maternal substance abusers, and (2) establish an equilibrium between demand for and supply of addiction treatment centers by improving Tennessee   s treatment landscape, while focusing on developing centers specially trained to handle issues relating to NAS and drug abuse. Drs. Tamara Wallace (D.N.P., NNP-BC, and Instructor in clinical nursing), Jessica Young (MD, MPH, and Assistant Professor at Vanderbilt University), and Lauren Walden (Candidate for Doctorate of Pharmacy (2016) at Lipscomb University) have been consulted throughout the formation of the current policy, and the team is awaiting correspondence from additional contacts.

We want to help make the campus greener by encouraging more students to ride their bikes, as biking is a more environmentally conscious mode of transport. There are a few alternate solutions to make The University of Tennessee more bike-friendly. First, we could post fliers around campus that are easy to read and present pedestrians with basic knowledge of the benefits of riding bikes compared to that of driving cars. Also, since Volunteer Boulevard is a four lane road, we could convert two of the existing four lanes into bike lanes. This would not be too costly, since the infrastructure already exists. As part of The University of Tennessee   s initiative to be more environmentally conscious, there will be an implementation of bike racks with the addition of a social navigation app for bikers that will be available to students for free via the UT app by the beginning of fall semester 2017. The app will be a permanent part of the University   s offered services.

Research has shown that most energy conservation programs are not benefitting those who need it most. This is not surprising since most programs are intended to promote energy savings generally. However, low-income families tend to need the savings provided by energy efficient cars, appliances and homes, but are least likely to be able to afford them. Thus, we will look at the problem from the viewpoint of consumer behavior researchers, governmental agencies and utility companies, through three panels on economics and consumer behavior, state energy efficiency and conservation programs, and utility energy efficiency and conservation programs.

Ghoname, Hall and Stainback participated in a nuclear security conference organized by the UT Institute for Nuclear Security and hosted by the Egyptian Council of Foreign Affairs (ECFA). Ghoname, who initiated the conference, is a member of ECFA. The conference focused on building international partnerships and encouraging new ideas for helping countries develop the infrastructures needed to support peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Many countries want nuclear energy, but have not yet developed the internal foundations needed to guarantee its safe use. Hall, Ghoname and Stainback were well-received throughout the course of their visit. Hall delivered opening remarks at the conference in Cairo. Ghoname   s presence at UT is opening new doors for cross-cultural relationships for the Institute. The trio took VIP tours across the country where they connected with Egyptian colleagues, successfully proposing memoranda of understanding with Alexandria University, the Library of Alexandria, and Aswan University. In Aswan, together with its Governor, Maj. Gen. Magdy Fouad Hegazy, Hall, Ghoname, and Stainback prompted interest in a sister city agreement for our local municipalities. And after a brief visit to Luxor, Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Arab Union of Engineering, Hesham M. Rezk and   Dr. Abdelelah Eltawil (respectively), presented Hall and Ghoname with an Egyptian Shield, a plaque acknowledging UT   s outreach efforts in Egypt. Back in Cairo, Egyptian Ambassador Gillane Allam invited them to dinner at the Diplomatic Club where they discussed potential collaboration with other figures. Amb. Allam is a career diplomat who held posts in India, Australia, and New Zealand. L to R    Maj. Gen. Eng. Dr. Abdelelah Eltawil, Dr. Stainback, Dr. Haidy Ghoname, Amb. Gillane Allam, and Dr. Hall UT   s Institute for Nuclear Security leads by example in hosting and delivering local and international workshops, lectures, and meetings designed to foster a culture of nuclear security that can address and resolve some of the toughest issues of our time. The Institute   s world-renowned experts promote excellence in global security through a vital understanding that academic and cultural exchange with government and industry is critical to building partnerships with countries interested in developing nuclear energy. L to R    Aswan Gov. Maj. Gen. Magdy Fouad Hegazy, Hall, Stainback, and Eltawil Prof. Hall is the UT ORNL Governor   s Chair for Global Nuclear Security and directs the Institute which is housed by the Howard H. Baker Jr. Center for Public Policy. His well-established expertise covers nuclear forensics, nuclear engineering, international transparency, nuclear nonproliferation, and nuclear security science and analysis. Prof. Stainback   s expertise is based on his lifelong career in nuclear security at high-risk facilities. His specialties include domestic safeguards, physical security, nuclear nonproliferation, and domestic International Atomic Energy Agency inspections. The UT delegates attracted plenty of positive Egyptian media during their visit. During the last week, Hall and Ghoname were interviewed by an Egyptian newspaper as well as    Good Morning Egypt   , a national TV program, (both translated into Arabic). Stainback remarked,    We experienced the history of civilization at every turn. It was a very enriching experience.    Over the course of the upcoming year, Ghoname will not only continue contributing her research to the Institute, but she will also devote her remaining time at UT to organizing a special INS conference slated for next May.   Ghoname   s knowledge, expertise, extensive connectivity, and enthusiasm for nuclear nonproliferation and global (nuclear) security is sure to continue opening new pathways for the Institute in the Middle East.

While current accounting methods have done a very good job at creating widely adopted standards, the authors identify both environmental and financial reasons to adopt better accounting methods in reporting carbon reductions. Technological innovations in measuring how increased renewable generation causes reductions in fossil fuel generation makes better accounting possible. As a result, more progress can be made toward the overall goal of lowering carbon emissions.

Energy, economic performance, and environmental quality are fundamentally linked. Energy industries provide valuable jobs and tax revenues, but those same jobs can also harm our environmental quality through the process of resource extraction and the generation of electricity.   States with large service sector economies avoid some energy-related impacts to the natural environment but also tend to put a greater energy burden on household finances. Lower energy burdens facilitate the attraction of business but also encourage more energy use and with it the potential for environmental degradation. This 2nd annual Energy Scorecard for the American States, provides data and a ranking on five criteria that capture different facets of a state   s energy footprint. energy assets and production economy and energy spending diverse energy portfolio affordability for residents ability to meet electricity needs environment and carbon emissions The top five states with the best ratings for these factors were Illinois, Washington, Colorado, Oregon, and California with Illinois ranked number one due to its diverse energy portfolio and service-based economy. The bottom five states were Alaska, Vermont, Kentucky, Mississippi, and Maine. Maine ranked 50 for lack of energy assets, inefficient energy use, an unbalanced portfolio and un-affordable energy. It is hoped that the states will use these rankings to assess and reflect on their own performance and identify ways to improve their natural environments and well-being of citizens.

A Policy Brief Baker Center researchers issued a new policy brief -  How Much Should Hybrids and Electric Vehicles Contribute to Roadway Funding? It  looks at  how hybrid and electric vehicles might  contribute to the funding of roads. Presently roadway funding is based on gas tax revenue and thus these vehicles pay a lesser share. Researchers on the brief are    Rebecca J. Davis, a pre-doctoral fellow of the National Bureau of Economic Research and PhD candidate in the UTK Dept. of Economics, Dr. Matt Murray, Baker Center Director, Boyd Center for Business & Economic Research and professor of Economics  and Dr. Jilleah Welch, Research Associate at the Baker Center.

Follow along to read updates on my research. Since my arrival two weeks ago, I have started networking with scholars, experts, and government officials and settling in to the Department of International Studies at De La Salle University. I am hosted by Dr. Renato Cruz de Castro, Professor of International Studies, Director of American Studies, and expert scholar on U.S.-Philippine security relations. Dr. de Castro was a Fulbright Scholar at the East-West Center in Washington, DC during the fall semester 2016, and during that time, he visited the Baker Center to give a talk on U.S.-Philippine-China security relations and the South China Sea dispute, which was so popular that people were spilling out of the Toyota Auditorium! Dr. de Castro is currently traveling, speaking at the Chatham House in London this week, and participating in a fellowship next week in Tokyo. I am honored to working with such a highly regarded and well published scholar! The current regime, led by President Rodrigo Duterte, has taken a different approach than his predecessor, President Benigno Aquino, who ordered the submission of an international arbitration case against China in January 2013. The award was announced in July 2016, shortly after President Duterte took office, and the international arbitration panel of judges decided in favor of the Philippines, ruling that China   s claims for the    features    (shoals, reefs, islands, islets, etc.) in the South China Sea was illegal in international law and that China   s buildup of the reefs and shoals to make them into habitable islands for military use was also a breach of international law. Despite the win for the Philippines, President Duterte has taken a more passive approach than former President Aquino, particularly in his approach to relations with China. Last week, I met with and interviewed the newly appointed Philippine Ambassador to China, Chito Santa Romana and learned that Duterte and his advisors have a plan for dual track negotiations with China, mainly involving confidence building measures (CBMs) with China. This is a typical approach in international diplomacy, working on improving bilateral relations on issues such as trade, people to people exchanges, and other    soft power    issues, that has been suspend for the past 3 years during the arbitration. By improving diplomatic relations on these other issues - as some of my own research has shown     the Philippines government hopes to be able to work towards a long term settlement of the South China Sea dispute in a manner than is not as hostile as the former regime   s arbitration case against China. Hopefully this bilateral approach will make settlement of the dispute more likely in the long term. In the short term, the current diplomatic approach has resulted in China agreeing to allow Filipino fishermen to fish in the area around the disputed Scarborough Shoals, which is viewed here as an important economic and diplomatic concession by China. I also recently attended a briefing on polling data about Filipino public opinion of foreign policy and the West Philippine Sea dispute, where my host colleague, Dr. Renato Cruz de Castro provided remarks about the poll. There were over 15 news media reporters, with cameras from CNN and all the Philippine news outlets, and the next day   s newspapers reported the findings of the public opinion poll on the cover pages. The main finding of the report was that 84% of those surveyed agreed that the Philippine government should be assertive toward China regarding the dispute. One of my questions to the panelists was about the government   s approach to disseminating information about the dispute to the public. Dr. Jay Batongbacal, professor of law at the University of the Philippines answered the question, which was cited in the newspapers. Though I personally wasn   t cited, I was pleased to see my question was interesting enough to report about in the national news! At the briefing, I sat next to the Philippine foreign correspondent for The Economist and the Singaporean Ambassador to the Philippines, both very interesting people. I also met several other people there, including the Counselor for Political Affairs at the U.S. Embassy, who I will be in touch with to interview in the near future.","link":"http:\/\/bakercenter.utk.edu\/krista-wiegand2\/"},{"title":"Check out our Spring 2017 Events Calendar!","content":"Check out our Spring 2017 Events Calendar! 338784 BC Spring 2017 Events Poster FINALFX2","link":"http:\/\/bakercenter.utk.edu\/spring-2017-events-calendar\/"},{"title":"New &#8220;On Point&#8221; article by Dr. Krista Wiegand!","content":"New    On Point    article by Dr. Krista Wiegand!

Dr. Parker will discuss the  Bankfull Characteristics of Alluvial Rivers Despite the clear evidence of a strong relation between bankfull characteristics of alluvial rivers and local hydrology, the physics behind this relation remains poorly understood. In this study, we present a framework for quantifying the formative processes leading to the establishment of bankfull geometry, in order to gain physical insight into the relation between bankfull characteristics and local hydrology. Together with the equation of momentum balance and a bed material load transport equation, we construct a numerical model, which predicts bankfull discharge and bankfull geometry for a given flow duration curve and upstream sediment supply, as well as other key input parameters such as characteristic slump block lifetime, which controls lateral channel migration rate. In addition, the model also describes the evolution process of bankfull characteristics. We make use of the model to predict the change in bankfull characteristics in response to variety of perturbations, such as change in sediment supply, change in bank vegetation type, and change in flow duration curve. We apply our model to the Minnesota River, MN, USA.

Most of the students who attended are involved in public policy centers on their campus, similar to the Howard Baker Center for Public Policy at The University of Tennessee Knoxville.   During the conference, we split into three different policy groups  citizenship, media, and inequality.   Citizenship included voting laws and national service, the media involved the prevalence of fake news, and inequality involved tolerance and dealing with diversity. I was involved with the inequality policy group, which created a plan to lessen intolerance in America by providing diversity education to young students across the country.   The problem we see in America is that many people have an intolerance toward those of other races, ethnicities, religions, and sexual orientations.   Americans do not know how to deal with people who are different from them in a civil way.   As a solution, the group I was working with has proposed to develop a diversity lesson plan.   Our lesson plan, if successful, will be taught in middle schools across the country.   We hope, in due time, to spread our plan to elementary schools and high schools as well.   Our goals in developing this lesson plan are to educate Americans about diversity, to eliminate false history, and to produce empathy toward others in the hearts of young people.   Education in the United States needs to become less America-centric and more world-centric.   We must teach history in a real and honest way.   America has not always been perfect, it is not perfect, and it never will be perfect.     Educators and administrators should not be afraid of teaching a history that will make America look bad.   It is important to teach the realities of Columbus   s exploration.   He did not discover America  the Native Americans were already here.   It is imperative to realize that Abraham Lincoln should not be called    Honest Abe.      We must be willing to be honest about America   s faults.   We should additionally be weary of calling America    the best country    or    the world police    because this type of teaching leads to white-supremacy and racism in the hearts and minds of young people.   Our lesson plan, if successful, will reduce these preconceived notions and racist tendencies in Americans.   We have asked for support from the Harvard Institute of Politics and will be appealing to Americorps, Teach for America, and other nonprofits to receive backing for our program.   We cannot force administrators and educators to adopt and implement our lesson plan, but we hope our plan will be implemented into as many schools as possible.   We believe education is the best way to change the culture and eliminate structural inequality in America. The other facet of our policy to reduce inequality and intolerance in America is our grassroots initiative.   This counterpart will focus on equipping people from different races, cultures, genders, sexual identities, and religions to run for public government offices.   This will allow growth in our country because people will begin to see that someone of a different culture and background can be just as good a President as someone from an American culture and background.   This counter-initiative also includes an opportunity for eighteen to thirty-year-olds who are leaders in their community to do research on diversity and inequality and develop proposed solutions to the problem.   This research would look similar to the already existent Fulbright.   Ultimately, our hope is to have this plan, both on the education and the grassroots side, implemented by Fall of 2017.   Each of us will be talking to our local congressmen and reaching out to our city   s educators during the Spring of 2017.   Over the summer, then, teachers can begin to plan how they will be implementing our lesson plan into their curriculum.   By Fall 2017, the plan should be ready to implement in the schools who agree to be involved.   It is a quick turnaround, but I believe with determination and persistence, it can be done. This conference taught me to go after whatever it is I want to pursue.   We visited the Kennedy Presidential Library, and we learned of Kennedy   s character and urgency in getting the job done.   Kennedy believed if something was to be done, it should be done immediately.   The spirit of the conference was similar to that sentiment.   Joe Goodwin and Congressman Dunahan both stated not to put limits on ourselves.   They told us that we could do anything we set our mind to doing as long as we had the persistence and tenacity to do it.   The Harvard IOP conference has inspired me to go out into my community and my world and truly make a difference.   I have learned that one person truly can make a difference, and young peoples    voices truly can be heard.   I learned my generation   s time is now.   In a divisive period in American history, it is my generation   s turn to reconnect America and bring peace and restoration to our nation.     I am so excited to see the great things my generation will do to change not only America, but the world!

He will discuss  The Road from the Paris Climate Agreement Abstract  In December 2015 over 190 countries met in Paris for the 21st meeting of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change where they succeeded in creating a new international climate agreement. Many have heralded the outcome as a groundbreaking achievement for international diplomacy and global climate action. Others have argued that the climate commitments that parties brought to the table in Paris are ultimately too weak to achieve the agreements    lofty aspirations. To better understand the significance of the new Paris Agreement we will review the recent history of the UN climate negotiations, how this outcome evolved from earlier failed attempts in this process, and what its impact could be. A more pressing question however may be what new future for global climate cooperation is now required of us after Paris, especially in light of the last federal election in the United States. To close the current gap between the Paris pledges for emission reductions, and what is needed to achieve our long-term goals for climate stabilization, we will need to continue to strengthen the profile of climate change as equal to other global priorities, and find new opportunities for enhanced climate action that all parties can embrace despite their differing domestic circumstances.

Thomas Gillespie, from UCLA, will give a 45 minute presentation and then lead a discussion with participants. His talk is entitled  Geospatial application for biodiversity and protected areas mapping Abstract  Dr. Gillespie will be discussing research that examines geospatial technologies that can be used to model species distributions and monitor protected areas.   The presentation will focus on case studies in Biodiversity Hotspots and address  1) the best methods for creating species distribution maps, 2) how to create biodiversity maps, and 3) the best remote sensing methods and metrics for monitoring protected areas. Dr. Thomas Gillespie is a Professor in the Department of Geography at UCLA with research interests in using geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing data for predicting patterns of species richness and rarity for plants and birds at a regional spatial scale. His botanical research will continue to focus on surveying tropical dry forests in biodiversity hotspots. This research is field intensive and taxonomically challenging but provides comparative floristic and structural data for regions where relatively little information exists.   His remote sensing research is divided into airborne and spaceborne sensors that can be used to measure and monitor terrestrial vegetation.   A long-term goal of his research is to develop algorithms that predict the distribution of plants and endangered species in tropical dry forest regions and California ecosystems.

Human trafficking is the world   s fastest growing criminal enterprise, and traffickers earn an estimated $150 billion annually in illicit profits worldwide.   According to the Department of Homeland Security, 100,000-300,000 American children are at risk of being trafficked for commercial sex in the United States each year.   Most shocking, a US child is a victim of human trafficking approximately every 2 minutes, with the average age of initial victimization between 12 and 14 for girls and 11 and 13 for boys.   An estimated 94 children are trafficked online in Tennessee each month  and of the 95 counties in Tennessee, Knox county ranks in the top 4 for trafficked areas, with over 100 cases of human trafficking reported in Knox County in 2015.   Tennessee is leading the fight against human trafficking with some of the strongest human trafficking laws in the country.   However, we also need to lead the fight by educating Tennessee   s children well enough to protect them from this horrendous crime. Human trafficking needs to be introduced into the Tennessee school curriculum in both middle school and high school.   Though this subject seems somewhat taboo in schools, it must be talked about because students are at risk starting at a mere eleven years of age or younger. The current education standards do not address human trafficking in explicit terms so the children have no knowledge or information about the crime.   This leaves all students, and especially at-risk students, extremely vulnerable to predators.   Tennessee focuses heavily on prosecution and rehabilitation, but the best case scenario would be to prevent the crimes from happening in the first place.   Several factors put children at a higher risk including poverty, dysfunctional homes, and low self-esteem  but studies show that teenage girls from all walks of life may be at risk simply due to the normal maturation process.   They are looking for romantic relationships which they frequently hide from their parents which easily increase their susceptibility to recruitment.   Predators are now heavily using social media as a means of trafficking children and teenagers.   Protecting our children starts with educating them about the dangers they face in this world.   My policy solution involves educating at-risk teens and preteens through an age appropriate curriculum titled Free to Resist Exploitation Education, or F.R.E.E. This curriculum is a multi-faceted program that will help teens and preteens, along with their families and communities, recognize human trafficking and teach them how to protect themselves and others from falling victim to this crime.   The program will first be implemented in high risk schools and then hopefully be implemented as a new subcomponent in the Tennessee Health and Wellness standards.   By educating these young people before they are at risk of exposure, we can prevent exploitation from ever occurring and eventually see a cultural change which will impact the entire human trafficking industry.   I am Anita Voorhees, and my hope is that this curriculum will prove successful and be implemented in the Health and Wellness curriculum statewide, eventually extend to other states across the country, and drastically decrease the exploitation of American children.   My ultimate dream is to see human trafficking end world-wide in my lifetime.

Springer With the closure of Lakeshore Mental Health institute in 2012, a hole in mental health care treatment has emerged and grown larger in the East Tennessee area. The lack of funding for local institutions is one of the main reasons for this gap in mental health care. Many institutions are incapable of providing their services because they simply cannot afford to house a large number of potential patients or hire enough staff to care for existing patients efficiently. Our policy would help solve the issue of acquiring and allocating funding to local institutions, such as the Helen Ross McNabb Center and Covenant Health, to provide and improve in-patient mental health care to those not served by the private sector The funding would be used to expand staffing, improve the standard of care, and increase the number of beds available for those who need inpatient care. By working with these local organizations to acquire funding, we hope to be able to increase the number of beds that each can offer for mental health services. This policy has the potential to decrease the amount of untreated individuals with mental health problems and to increase the overall health of the East Tennessee area.","link":"http:\/\/bakercenter.utk.edu\/baker-center-2017-policy-challenge-addressing-mental-health\/"},{"title":"Baker Center 2017 Policy Challenge: Homeless Prevention","content":"Baker Center 2017 Policy Challenge  Homeless Prevention Participants  Christian Burfield, Hayden Bliss, Peyton Hansen, Roby Sturgill Our policy is all about helping the homeless community of Knoxville transition to a better life, starting with a steady job. Homelessness not only puts stress on those it directly affects, but also those in the surrounding area.    Many homeless aren   t to the point of destitution, but still need assistance to become self sufficient again.    Employment issues are the number one cause of homelessness according to self-reports given by Knoxville area homeless. The lack of employment is also problematic because it leads to further complications when the homeless try to re-establish themselves . We hope to present a potential solution to help the homeless who are in or attempting to enter the job market. Those who access the eighteen services that partner with the Knoxville Homeless Management Information System can be added to a list for potential hire for participating businesses to review. Businesses that are interested in the program are incentivized to participate by being rewarded tax breaks or credits for each individual that they hire. These credits can be applied to business or property tax to help offset federal excise tax as well as state sales tax. Although we feel as we have come up with a great system to help the homeless get back on their feet, just like everything, there are a few potential problems we need to solve first. These people will still be well below the poverty line at $19,000 annually. There is the potential that we could be hiring individuals with an extensive criminal background that could be a problem to the company and other employees. A few other problems could be that it takes away from the normal hiring process and we are not sure how long people would be willing to stay at their jobs, which is two major problems for the companies that would be hiring them. The companies that participate will be hiring for jobs that are focused on low skill work that is routine. The companies are encouraged to provide small benefits packages like healthcare, easier ways of getting food, or access to more reliable transportation but it is not required. Our hope is that employment for those individual and families struggling with homelessness will be the stepping stone to self-sufficiency and prosperous lives and simultaneously benefit the local area.","link":"http:\/\/bakercenter.utk.edu\/baker-center-2017-policy-challenge-homeless-prevention\/"},{"title":"Baker Center 2017 Policy Challenge: Tennessee\u2019s Homeless Rehabilitation Policy","content":"Baker Center 2017 Policy Challenge  Tennessee   s Homeless Rehabilitation Policy Our policy solution focuses on trust, awareness, enrollment, and coverage.

To start, legal amnesty must be extended to individuals pursuing or interested in treatment to remove legal obstacles to seeking help. Next, recovery service providers and homeless organizations can conduct trust-building activities like needle exchanges to help improve health in users as well as increasing interactions between users and help services.

As of January 2, 2017, there are at least 1,757 completely smoke-free college campuses in the United States, 1,468 of which are also entirely tobacco-free. Nearly 300 of these campuses emerged in the last year alone, showing both Americans    changing attitudes on smoking and campus policy makers    efforts to curb unhealthy behavior.2  Many universities comparable to UT, including Belmont University, Tennessee Technological University, (fellow land grant institution) University of Kentucky, and many top 25 public research institutions, have adopted policies to ban smoking, offering several models for implementation of tobacco-free and smoke-free policies at UT. Careful examination of tobacco-free and smoke-free policies at these universities and many others yield three clear focal points  tell, treatment, and train.  Successful policy implementation combined with adequate and timely notification about the policy provisions is a crucial first measure. Providing evidence-based tobacco treatment services is the next important step. Cessation strategies are most effective when there is a combination of medication, counseling, smoke-free policy, cigarette tax increases, and media education. The third and final strategy to tobacco-free policy development is training supervisors, faculty, administrators, and student leaders on the policy and how to approach violators. Ultimately, curbing tobacco influence on campuses could prevent a new cohort of lifetime smokers  therefore, a smoke-free and tobacco-free campus is imperative to public health at the University of Tennessee.","link":"http:\/\/bakercenter.utk.edu\/baker-center-2017-policy-challenge-a-smoke-free-and-tobacco-free-campus\/"},{"title":"Baker Center 2017 Policy Challenge: Permanent Tiny Housing","content":"Baker Center 2017 Policy Challenge  Permanent Tiny Housing Participants Jackson Glen Cain, Bryson A.

The team is working on a policy brief that extends Knoxville   s plan to end homelessness by encouraging the development of tiny homes, which are socially and economically efficient small homes. We are drawing on the experiences of city governments that have enacted permanent housing policies. These policies have been found to foster better health outcomes for the homeless and to be cost-effective. The city of Knoxville and Knox County has made reducing homelessness and securing permanent housing for those individuals some of its main goals  however, there is a lack of concrete strategies to employ these plans. Our team has identified a solution to this problem. This policy specifically tackles homelessness and is an active effort to lead people toward more stable lives. In order to gain insight into implementation, we have contacted existing tiny home communities in other cities for information. We have made attempts at contacting   Rev.

Our policy was a drug resistance program aimed at school-aged children. It is very difficult to try to change young adults when they are already stuck in their ways, so our best bet is to minimize to desire to participate beforehand. Looking back on what we   ve done so far, I think we   ve all learned a lot through this process. I think we underestimated how much goes into developing a policy a little bit in the beginning. It must be very detailed, and we were focusing on the overarching theme a lot at first. But over time we became a lot more engaged in our resource and it allowed us to naturally start including a lot of detail. Everything became a lot smoother once we were fully engaged with our research and information. Looking forward, I think we   re pretty excited about having our policy evaluated. Our policy could really help a lot of kids. Hopefully we can win the challenge, but even if we don   t I think just having done it taught us a lot about what goes into developing public policy.","link":"http:\/\/bakercenter.utk.edu\/baker-center-2017-policy-challenge-anti-drug-program-for-school-children\/"},{"title":"Baker Center 2017 Policy Challenge: Valuing Knoxville Veterans\u2019 Mental Health","content":"Baker Center 2017 Policy Challenge  Valuing Knoxville Veterans    Mental Health Participants Bristoe Mace Bible, Megan Elizabeth Finan, Riley Robert Phillips, Garrett A. Trosper, and Cameron James Walsh. Our group has taken on the task of formulating a proposal to better aid Knoxville Veterans. This proposal is necessary because the United States has been regularly engaged in conflicts overseas as part of the    War on Terror.    As a result, more and more veterans have returned home in need of immediate mental rehabilitation. These veterans are waitlisted by the Department of Veterans Affairs until service can be provided, which may be up to two weeks. The failure of the V.A. to care for our country s soldiers is a topic of vicious debate and virtue signaling between both political parties. Our nation has an ethical responsibility to help those who served it in its time of need. Every 72 minutes a veteran in the U.S. commits suicide due to the struggles of re-adapting to civilian life, and many of these veterans are right here in our hometown of Knoxville, TN. In order to more efficiently care for our Knoxville Veterans, our proposal aims to re-evaluate our current approach to triaging veteran   s care, as well as, re-structuring resource flows to better serve the ones who deserve it the most. Our policy will look to build from programs currently in place, but also take steps beyond raising awareness. We are currently reaching out to local programs to understand the true scope of veteran mental health issues in our area. Thus, not only will our policy take major steps to get current Knoxville Veterans the care they need, but it will also look out for generations before and after us. Moreover, we plan to monitor our plan   s success with metrics and KPI   s through data collection and various surveys. This will help us gain deeper understanding of patient wait times, quality of care, and quantity of services offered in our region. This also offers accountability.","link":"http:\/\/bakercenter.utk.edu\/baker-center-2017-policy-challenge-valuing-knoxville-veterans-mental-health\/"},{"title":"Baker Center 2017 Policy Challenge: Renew Tennessee","content":"Baker Center 2017 Policy Challenge  Renew Tennessee Participants Donald Gregory Butcher, James Collin Kelley, Richard Alexander Pennycuff, Luke Powers, and Samuel Dixon Slavik The project is going very well and our group dynamic is great. We are currently underway in completing our final policy draft and will be shooting the video in the next couple of days. According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons 46.4% of inmates are in prison for drug related offenses and according to CrimeInAmerica.net within five years of being released 77% of drug offenders were arrested again. Too many folks struggling with drug addiction end up incarcerated with no vision of a life beyond the one they know. It   s nearly impossible to find gainful employment when they complete their sentences and enter the real world and often they have alienated their families and friends as well. Tackling this issue is a two-fold approach. For non-violent offenders, we would propose a strategy that relies on rehabilitation, job skills, and education. These strategies are important to address for both the present and the long term. In the present, people who are drug addicted will be given the resources to achieve earned success, and in the long-term, we are discovering how to more effectively address addiction. Our policy is called the Renew Tennessee policy and its aim is to reduce the number of individual being arrested multiple times for non-violent drug offences by giving them an opportunity to further their education while at the same time saving the the state a lot of money.   The cost on average to put a person is $28,000 per year.   To be able to participate in this program the person would have to do the following as part of this program  Be a non-violent repeat offender Complete 2 years of community college  other acceptable programs Complete rehab Meet their parole officer to insure the individual is doing the work to stay a part of the program","link":"http:\/\/bakercenter.utk.edu\/12243-2\/"},{"title":"Baker Center 2017 Policy Challenge: Veterans Housing Initiative","content":"Baker Center 2017 Policy Challenge  Veterans Housing Initiative Veterans Housing Initiative    The Veterans Housing Initiative policy team is made up of 3 undergraduate Economic and Accounting students from The University of Tennessee  Kenneth Presnell, Gabriel Bolas, and Parth Patel. Our team is working on a policy brief that seeks to reduce the amount of homeless veterans in the state of Tennessee. Approximately 1200 veterans in the state of Tennessee are considered homeless. While there are currently some programs in place to combat veteran homelessness, many of them only temporarily solve the issue. Our policy intends to get down to the core of the issue  the lack of funding for adequate veteran housing. Our proposal will involve subsidized housing that will be provided through a continued state tax on the dividends and interest earned on investments, better known as the Hall tax. Under our plan, part of this current tax will be given to veterans in the form of a housing voucher that can be used in combination with the HUD-VA program that is already in place. Our policy presents the idea of a pilot study in the Knoxville area. If the pilot is successful, the results could bear additional benefits to the state, such as an increase in housing values and a decrease in the homeless population. Overall, this policy could be very beneficial to everyone, but especially the almost 1200 homeless veterans who have gone without adequate housing.

Food waste is often overlooked as a current issue  in fact even we overlooked it. After researching food insecurity in the Knoxville area, we realized there was a much closer and less addressed issue of food waste that surrounds our campus and therefore our lives on a day-to-day basis. With around 133 billions pounds of food wasted a year in the U.S. we knew this was an issue we wanted to address. However, we wanted to focus this issue closer to home and closer to an area we could influence and relate to. For this reason, we are creating a policy addressing the issues surrounding the amount of food the University of Tennessee wastes on an annual basis. Our goal is to bring attention to this issue and shed light on various solutions that are currently in place on campus and future solutions we hope to install through our policy. Using the Environmental Protection Agency   s food hierarchy we hope to utilize the measures that the university is already taking and develop them into a more sustainable long-term plans. With these initiatives we hope to create a more knowledgeable, sustainable, and food conscious campus.","link":"http:\/\/bakercenter.utk.edu\/12250-2\/"},{"title":"Baker Scholars Recognized for National Scholarships and Fellowships!","content":"Baker Scholars Recognized for National Scholarships and Fellowships!

Since I   ve been here in Manila, I have been busy conducting interviews, giving talks, meeting with really smart Philippine political scientists, international law specialists, and other scholars, and starting to write my next book, with my colleague Emilia Powell, about the peaceful resolution of territorial disputes. It would be too much to write about all the interviews and meetings I   ve had since I   ve been here, so I   ll give a sample from the last couple weeks. Three weeks ago, I traveled to Taiwan for an international conference and met some great people working on the South China Sea dispute too, and am looking forward to keeping in touch with them. That same week, I traveled to Brunei to meet with US Ambassador Carl Allen and the other embassy officials at the US Embassy there. We had a great exchange of ideas and discussion about the current state of the South China Sea dispute and they were interested to hear about my research in the Philippines. I also presented my research at the University of Brunei Darussalam Faculty of Social Sciences, and again, had an excellent discussion afterwards. Last week was a whirlwind of events that gives you an idea of what I   ve been doing in Manila. On Monday, I visited the Executive Offices of Malaca  ang, the Presidential Palace compound, to interview a former military chief of staff and director of the security cluster for the cabinet. On Tuesday, I gave a talk at the Department of Foreign Affairs, sponsored jointly by the Foreign Service Institute, the Armed Forces of the Philippines, and the National Defense College of the Philippines, where I spoke to diplomats and military officers about the South China Sea dispute, an issue of great concern to them. There I met with former and current secretaries of national defense, former and current ambassadors, former and current Senators and Congressmen, and other esteemed officials, with whom I had the great honor to speak. On Wednesday, I attended a private forum about fisheries in the South China Sea with embassy officials from the US, Australia, and Singapore, the former secretary of foreign affairs during the Aquino administration, former Senators and Congressmen, and other experts. That same day, I meet with officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs for an interview about the international arbitration case and the Philippines    relationship with China. On Thursday, I interviewed an international legal specialist at the University of the Philippines Law Center, then gave another talk at UP Asian Center to a great group of scholars, students, and alumni of the university, and met with former diplomats and scholars. Friday I gave another talk at my host university, De La Salle University, sponsored by the Department of International Studies, where I have been working the last few months. Today, I   m attending the opening session of the Senate. It has been very fruitful to conduct all the research I   ve done here, but now the challenge is organizing all of it and writing about the theories and results in papers and my next book.

Voter identification laws have had an impact on voter turnout since 1950 when the laws were first implemented. While the first set of voter identification laws was relatively simple and only required a document with the voter   s name on it, the laws have become increasingly stricter with fewer forms of identification accepted at the polls. In states with the most rigorous sets of voter identification laws (states with both strict and photo voter identification laws), voters are required to present a government-issued form of identification with a photo  if the voter does not have the proper form of identification, then he or she must vote on a provisional ballot, obtain the correct form of identification and present it to his or her election commission before the ballot will be counted. These laws target specific groups such as minorities, the elderly, the poor, and the young. In this analysis, I seek to answer this question  Do strict, photo voter identification laws affect young voter turnout? Morgan Chance will analyze young voter turnout, which is defined as turnout among voters between the ages of 18 and 24, in presidential elections from  1996-2012 and in off-year congressional elections in 2002, 2010, and 2014.

It was during this month that the Russian Federation formally annexed the previously Ukrainian territory of Crimea. This event resulted in ripples throughout the international community, drawing strong condemnation from the United States (U.S.), European Union (EU),  Australia, Japan, and many other countries (Khlebnikov 2014). Eventually, in response to perceived  Russian expansion, these countries placed economic sanctions upon Russia for its actions (Dreyer and  Popescu 2014) The purpose of these sanctions was to showcase displeasure with Russian involvement in  Ukraine and Crimea and ultimately to persuade Russia to allow Crimea to remain a part of Ukraine (Newsroom     European Commission 2017). In retaliation, Russia enacted counter sanctions within the agricultural sector against sanctioning countries (Reuters 2016). With the resulting deterioration of Russian relations with Western nations, these sanctions are among the most important topics in the international relations sphere. As these sanctions were so recently enacted, there has been little study of the resulting economic effects of these sanctions on EU countries. As there are many EU countries who rely heavily upon trade with Russia for energy, defense, and financial products, it is safe to assume that there should be some form of loss trade for these countries. This loss trade should be magnified for countries as one moves geographically closer to Russia due to existing trade ties. This is the purpose of my study, to better equip foreign policy makers to better understand the consequences of the 2014 Russian Sanctions for countries that choose to enact them. By adding to knowledge of potential unintentional effects of the 2014 Russian Sanctions, I hope to spur more informed conversations amongst foreign policy makers worldwide.

The application of military force is utilized by both regional and global powers, with wide-reaching implications. While the United States has repeatedly chosen to deploy the military in crisis situations around the globe since World War II, its actions have not always achieved the desired results or have had unintended consequences that undermine US security or foreign policy objectives. Amid calls for a reevaluation of the process leading to intervention, many experts look to international law and the international community to guide the response to this evolving norm. One critical element to the future of this debate is the standards set forth by the Responsibility to Protect (R2P), an emerging norm backed by the UN as a framework to manage crises that could demand international intervention. The central question to this study is  Would embracing the principles of the Responsibility to Protect improve the success of US-backed military intervention efforts? This paper will examine past interventions  and seek to determine better guidance to the future of implementing military intervention.

Which specific social and political conditions promote the descriptive representation of women in subnational political units? The first section presents an analytical review of literature to identify the social and political conditions found by researchers as creating access points and spaces that aid women   s presence in subnational politics. Collectively, these social and political conditions, including decentralization, create a theoretical framework that can be utilized in comparative case analysis. The second and empirical part of this paper applies several of these identified conditions to the subnational sphere in two different cultural contexts, Peru and Russia. This comparative analysis fosters a more in-depth understanding of the complexities surrounding women   s representation in subnational politics as I find that social and political conditions, most especially decentralization, are highly contingent on cultural context and existing gendered political structures and dynamics. The collision of political, social, and cultural forces actually may work against women   s ability to gain a voice in prominent political processes. A focus on the two countries of Peru and Russia, with their distinct social and political milieus, allows me to provide a much more nuanced analysis in noting the degree to which these political and social conditions have almost paradoxically helped in opening spaces of representation for women while oftentimes challenging these spaces. This comparative analysis in turn enables me to explore the relevance and salience of using social and political forces to better understand women   s subnational representation.

Baker Jr. Center for Public Policy has been involved in a major research endeavor funded by the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC), in partnership with the Boyd Center for Business and Economic Research and the Center for Transportation Research, and West Virginia University. Dr. Matt Murray and Dr. Charles Sims are leading the effort out of the Baker Center.   The focus of the research is the coal industry ecosystem within the Appalachian Region and the implications of declining coal employment and production for economic development.   A draft final report was provided to ARC in June.    This project represented a significant opportunity to draw upon the economic development expertise of the university to address a pressing challenge    Many areas of Appalachia have been devastated by the falling demand for coal.   For the nation as a whole, there were almost 800 thousand coal jobs in the 1920s.   By 2015, the number of jobs had slipped to 65,971. For the ARC region, employment stood at just 38,193 in the same year. These employment setbacks have rippled across the region leading to widespread unemployment and underemployment, and aggravating already dire socioeconomic conditions. The report that the UT-WVU team has developed provides an overview of coal employment and production in the Appalachian region, an analysis of the coal industry supply chain and regional coal-fired power plants, an examination of the effects of coal activity on the transportation infrastructure and the implications of a shrinking coal ecosystem on industry occupations and government revenues that support elementary and secondary school funding. Charles Sims, director of the Baker Center   s Energy & Environment Program and associate professor of Economics, said    The team found that the closing of coal-fired plants had very little to do with the fluctuation in coal prices due to long-term coal contracts in the electricity generation industry.    Instead he noted that primary risk factors shortening the economic lifetime of coal-fired plants include    the cost of constructing the plant, the value of the land where the plant is located, macroeconomic factors, and whether the plant is in a regulated market.    Together the findings are intended to help federal, state and local policymakers address the consequences of falling coal demand on the Appalachian region.    This project represented a significant opportunity to draw upon the economic development expertise of the university to address a pressing challenge,    said Matt Murray, director of the Baker Center and associate director of the Boyd Center.    Partnering with West Virginia University added to the team   s capabilities and places the project in the center of coal country.    The research team will be traveling to Washington D.C. soon to present their findings to the staff of the Commission.   The team will then return to their respective institutions to finalize the program of work.

Baker Jr. Center for Public Policy and associate professor of political science, spent five months as a Fulbright Senior Scholar in the Philippines during spring and summer 2017. Wiegand was one of five UT faculty members awarded a Fulbright during the 2016   17 academic year. Only senior-level academics are awarded a Fulbright Senior Scholarship.    My Fulbright experience was immensely rewarding, since I would never have been able to learn what I did from just reading books and articles from afar,    said Wiegand.    There is nothing that can replace living in a country and conducting field research to gain in-depth understanding of their political issues.    Wiegand was based in the Department of International Studies at De La Salle University in Manila, where she conducted research about the role of the Philippines in the contentious South China Sea dispute with China, Vietnam, Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Vietnam. She spent most of her time interviewing government officials, former government officials, scholars, and experts about Philippine foreign policies related to the maritime dispute. The purpose of Wiegand   s research was to explore the motivation of former president Benigno Aquino   s regime seeking international arbitration against China in 2013, the process of the arbitration from 2013 to 2016, and the consequences of the arbitration decision for the Philippines in its relations with China and the United States. She also gave several talks at universities in Manila, at the University of Brunei Darussalam and the US Embassy in Brunei, and at the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), sponsored jointly by the Foreign Service Institute, the Armed Forces of the Philippines, and the National Defense College of the Philippines. At DFA, Wiegand spoke to a crowd of 100 diplomats and military officers, and met with former and current secretaries of national defense, former and current ambassadors, former and current members of Congress, and other esteemed officials. While in Southeast Asia, she also attended the World International Studies Conference in Taiwan and presented papers at the Philippine Political Science Association annual meeting and the International Studies Association Asia meeting in Hong Kong. Wiegand is currently working on three papers based on her research and is also using the material for part of a book project. She will talk about her time as a Fulbright Senior Scholar at a Baker Caf   this fall at the Baker Center.

William Fulbright Foreign Scholarship Board. Rangnekar will conduct research in Karnataka as part of a project to examine the demand for informal healthcare providers in India. Rangnekar is one of over 1,900 U.S. citizens who will conduct research, teach English, and provide expertise abroad for the 2018-2019 academic year through the Fulbright U.S. Student Program. Recipients of Fulbright awards are selected on the basis of academic and professional achievement as well as record of service and leadership potential in their respective fields. This year, the University of Tennessee had 18 Fulbright recipients, breaking a school record. The Fulbright Program is the flagship international educational exchange program sponsored by the U.S. government and is designed to build lasting connections between the people of the United States and the people of other countries. The Fulbright Program is funded through an annual appropriation made by the U.S. Congress to the U.S. Department of State   s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs. Participating governments and host institutions, corporations, and foundations around the world also provide direct and indirect support to the Program, which operates in over 160 countries worldwide. When asked what it means to have received this scholarship, Rangnekar claims,    Receiving the Fulbright-Nehru grant means everything to my family and I. The grant not only gives me the ability to experience firsthand the rapidly evolving Indian healthcare system, but it also gives me the opportunity to immerse myself in the culture that contributes significantly to my identity as a South Asian American. I am most excited that I get to combine my interests in medicine and economics through my research, but also learn more about my heritage by living and working in India.    Rangnekar is a Baker Scholar and will be graduating the the first class of the Public Policy Analytics Minor, housed in the Baker Center. Additionally, Dr. Katie Cahill, Associate Director of the Baker Center, is one of her thesis advisors and is working with her to secure a second affiliation at an academic institution in New Delhi.    I could never have achieved what I have without the community and support that I received from the Baker Scholars Program, Haslam Scholars Program, Economics Department, and Office of National Scholarships and Fellowships. It s a support system that I will forever be grateful for and that I will certainly be visiting whenever I come back to visit Rocky Top!    Gabriella LaRose, Baker Ambassador and Scholar, Presents Research at Chicago Conference Gabriella LaRose, a junior at the University of Tennessee, will be presenting research at the Midwest Political Science Association (MPSA) Conference in Chicago, IL. LaRose  is a philosophy major with a concentration in law and politics and a minor in political science. She has been actively involved with the Baker Center since her freshman year when she was a member of the Baker Center   s Living and Learning Community. She now serves as a Baker Ambassador and a Baker Scholar. LaRose   s research titled,    Refugees and Terrorism  An Empirical Analysis of Refugee Flows and Domestic and Suicide Terrorism    examines the relationship between incoming refugee flows and domestic and suicide terrorism. She  finds that incoming refugees neither increased nor decreased the number of domestic or suicide terrorist incidents. When asked why this research is important, LaRose  says,    In light of rhetoric by President Trump and other government representatives, we sought to show evidence that refugees are not dangerous in the way they are portrayed to be. Also, with the Syrian Refugee crisis and mass exodus of refugees from Africa, it is important to let populations know that refugees are seeking shelter, not seeking a platform for terrorist action.    LaRose  is a co-author with Dr. Sambuddah Ghatak and Dr. Hement Sharma. After the research was submitted and accepted for the conference, Dr. Ghatak asked LaRose  to present to give her more experience in a professional setting. The research has also given her the chance to learn new research techniques, like coding and modeling. She says she had never used this kind of research before and, while it was challenging, she found the importance of becoming familiar with these research techniques. She hopes that speaking at MPSA will improve her presentation skills and allow her to become more comfortable with presenting other research projects she has worked on. Gabriella gives credit to the Baker Center for the opportunities it has presented her with.    Since I was a freshman, staff and older students at the Baker Center have encouraged me to ask for what I want, take advantage of every opportunity, and be grateful to those who helped me along the way. I really wouldn t be presenting without the support they ve given me over the years.    Greta Roberts, Baker Ambassador, Spends Semester in Morocco Greta Roberts is a junior double majoring in political science and history, with   a minor in Arab studies. She is also a Baker Ambassador for the Baker Center. This spring semester, Greta is studying in Morocco. She says she was initially interested in studying in the Arab world to focus on improving her Arabic language skills, as well as discover if living abroad is something she would enjoy after graduation. She chose to studying in Morocco for the culture it presents. Greta is living in a smaller city, Meknes, as opposed to bigger, more populated city and claims that this has given her the opportunity to truly immerse herself in the culture. Greta is taking multiple Arabic courses at her university, one of which focuses on Derija, the dialect spoken in Morocco. She is also taking courses on Peace and Conflict, Gender Studies of Morocco, and Migration and Transnationalism. She says it has been a very interesting experience hearing her Moroccan professors perspectives on world politics, the current Trump administration, and the role that Islam is playing in the world. When asked about what advice she has for others wanting to study in the Arab world she says that culture shock does exist, but no more in the Arab world than in other countries. She says it   s more important to note that there aren   t nearly as many amenities and luxuries in Morocco as there are in the U.S. She says heating is not very common there and it can get chilly in the winter, so bring warm clothes. However, Greta feels her overall experience has been magnificent and she suggests that everyone should step out of their comfort zone and immerse themselves in another culture.  Overall, everyone I   ve met here as been extremely friendly and helpful. Many Moroccans are just really glad that you   re willing to experience their culture and live in their country. Also, the food is here  amazing!  Jacob Hayes, MPPA Student and US State Department Summer Intern I am a second-year law student at the University of Tennessee Knoxville Law School and I spent my summer being an intern for the US Department of State. The US State Department places an emphasis on both national and international diplomacy. Employees at the US State Department are to be exemplars of American diplomacy, representing and advocating US interests on an international level. My summer in Washington, D.C. working for the U.S. Department of State was the culmination of a year-long application process involving multiple interviews and conversations with Department officials. Upon being granted security clearance, I served in the Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation within the office of Weapons of Mass Destruction Terrorism.  I had the chance to work with some of the best experts in the U.S. government who were all dedicated public servants. They taught me so much about diplomacy and the foreign policy process.  Everyday, I learned something new about working within the administrative state and gained new tools for making myself competitive for the job market. Living in Washington D.C. and experiencing its energy and diversity reinforced my ambition of working there after graduation. My passion for international politics and policy formation grew even stronger after hours of conversation with the people working there, and my preconceived notions about federal bureaucracy were dispelled.  I am so grateful for the support of the Howard Baker Jr. Center faculty who  made my experience possible.  Lucy Greer, Baker Ambassador, Baker Scholar, and Boren Scholar in Jordan Lucy Greer is a senior at the University of Tennessee Knoxville majoring in political science with a concentration in international affairs. She has received a prestigious Boren Scholarship that has allowed her to spend this year studying Arabic and researching international politics in Jordan. The Boren Scholarship is an initiative of the National Security Education Program. The program provides funding opportunities for US undergraduate students to study less frequently taught languages in regions vital to US interests such as Africa, Asia, Central and Eastern Europe, Eurasia, Latin America, and the Middle East. Because of her avid interest in history and Arabic studies, Lucy always knew she wanted to pursue a career in diplomacy and international affairs. She has wanted to apply for the Boren Scholarship since her freshman year of college, as the program stresses both national security and government service. The language aspect additionally contributed to her decision, because the  program would give  her an opportunity to practice speaking Arabic daily. When asked why she wanted to go to Jordan, Lucy cited the two foremost places she wanted to study abroad  Morocco and Jordan. Her main interest lies in the Middle Eastern region called Levant. This region includes Jordan, Iraq, Syria, Palestine, and Lebanon. As for her research, Lucy is working on her Baker Scholar thesis while abroad in Jordan. While there she plans to examine American support for the moderate Syrian opposition in the Syrian Civil War under US President Barack Obama and its relationship to the  war in Iraq. When asked what sparked her interest in this research topic, Lucy responded,    A lot of the discourse coming out of the Iraq War was the United States should not have invaded, yet in the case of Syria many argued that we should have done more. That contrast really fascinates me.    She said  that the most difficult part of her research process has been her research of Syria. Much of the information coming out of Syria is incomplete, and the fracturing of different forces within Syria makes the information that does exist difficult to fully trust and rely upon. When asked what the most important thing she has learned so far in Jordan is she advises,    Don   t be afraid to speak in Arabic at the grocery store because even though you sound like an idiot at least you   re getting some practice.       Don   t be afraid to speak in Arabic at the grocery store because even though you sound like an idiot at least you   re getting some practice.    Lucy has most enjoyed the opportunity to speak Arabic in the context of her everyday life while in Jordan. She believes it shows her that all her hard work in her Arabic studies has paid off. Furthermore, she states that she has had the opportunity to meet many incredible people during her time thus far. Lucy is loving her experience abroad, as she advises,    if you can go abroad at all, even only for a week or two, definitely seize that opportunity.       If you can go abroad at all, even only for a week or two, definitely seize that opportunity.    When asked what she would say to others who are pursuing research, Lucy advises,    Find a policy area that is so massively interesting you ll never get tired of it. What I love about all the Baker Scholars is their individual passions for specific areas of policy, they live their passion from the inside out.    Nathan Timbs, Baker Ambassador and Intern for Senator Bob Corker   I am a junior studying political science with a concentration in international affairs. I am also a religious studies major with a minor in Arabic studies. I have always had an interest in international politics  disputes  and government types, with a focus   in the Middle Eastern region. I was fortunate to serve as an intern in Senator Bob Corker   s Knoxville office over the summer. His position as Chair of the Foreign Relations Committee only increased my interest in international politics. My dream career is to work for the U.S. State Department in Washington, DC, or abroad in an embassy. This career choice is fueled by my love of international relations but also by a strong desire to impact the world in a beneficial way. What was your first day like? Your last day? I did not know what to expect on my first day, but I was given a packet of Senator Corker s statements and stances on hot button issues currently being debated including health care, Syria, and Cuba. I was then trained on how to answer constituents    questions, which could be categorized under one of two groupings  comments and casework.  Once I began answering calls, I felt like I was finally a part of government and making a difference. Being able to finally make an impact felt amazing, and I could not wait to help people on a daily basis.  My last day was a fitting end to my time as an intern for Senator Corker. The night before I stayed up to watch the final health care reform vote on CSPAN. It failed 49-51, and with that vote, the weeks of comments and concerns from constituents concluded in an end result. I was able to fully witness government work right in front of me as local feedback and debates on Capitol Hill culminated into a vote that will impact the nation for years to come. I was saddened to know that I was having to leave behind unfinished casework, as I could np longer help constituents with their needs. Overall, this internship strengthened my appreciation for government because I was able to see it work efficiently and effectively from a perspective I had never before witnessed. What was the most important thing you learned during your internship? I learned two very important things during my internship. The first was to be calm and professional in every situation. Answering phone calls from angry constituents sometimes tested my patience, since not everyone follows the golden rule of    treat others as you would wish to be treated,    but I always reminded myself that I was first and foremost a representative of Senator Corker. Secondly, I learned the importance of making a good impression on those around me whether it be a coworker, a boss, or a constituent. Presentation of self was critical in my position, and I realized that this internship would have consequences for my future.  I learned that working hard, going above what I was being asked, and trying to always be professional would serve me well in the future.  What was the most surprising moment? The most surprising moment, and also a very exciting moment, was when I saw all of our work on our    Joint Operation    veterans event come to fruition. The weeks of work that I had done assisting the planning and execution of this event resulted in a resounding success in which over 500 veterans were able to receive assistance for various needs and issues. Since I had never helped plan an event of this scale, I was amazed at how well our office had executed this event.   Seeing the work that I did directly impact constituents made all of the effort more than worth it.  I was surprised that government could work so effectively to meet specific needs, rather than the disaster that is presented by the media on a daily basis. Being on the inside of government will make anyone truly appreciate the meaningful work being done.  How did the experience impact your future plans? My experience reinforced my love for government and public policy, but I did not expect the largest benefit I received. Through my internship I came to the realization that I have an intense passion for helping others and that I want to do that on an international scale. This experience also inspired me to apply for an internship next summer with Senator Corker and the Foreign Relations Committee. Without the knowledge gained from this internship and connections I have made, this process would have been much harder, if not impossible. What will you always remember? During my internship, I was fortunate enough to serve as the representative for Senator Corker at a naturalization ceremony. For those who do not know, a naturalization ceremony is the legal proceeding individuals go through to officially become U.S. citizens. The moment 30 individuals from 20 nationalities became U.S. citizens is one I will never forget, as they all had expressions of happiness and achievement.  This made me realize how important government is and how great it can be.

Baker Center   s Global Security Workshop, Dr. Brandon Prins, Professor of Political Science at UT, presented the initial findings from his forthcoming coauthored book,    Pirate Lands  State Capacity and Maritime Piracy.    Speaking to an audience of graduate students and research faculty from the Department of Political Science at the Baker Center, Dr. Prins provided a fascinating conversation on the origins of modern piracy in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. With research that has received funding from the Department of Defense, Dr. Prins challenged the general assumption that modern piracy emerges from failed states. Rather, pirates rely on some degree of state capacity in order to sell their goods and find potential targets. While modern pirates do tend to avoid operating around countries that have the capacity to find and sanction them, these organizations also wish to avoid areas that completely lack roads, electric grids, or basic government services. Pirates, therefore, seek out locations where there is a low risk of being targeted by the state, but increase their ability to sell their ill-gotten goods. Dr. Prins noted in his presentation that many conventional measures of state capacity fail to capture this proverbial    Goldilocks    relationship between basic state strength and opportunities for piracy. To address this shortcoming in the previous literature, Dr. Prins relies on innovative measures of satellite photos of night lights as well as paved roads to capture when and where piracy emerges in fragile states. Using original data on the location of piracy incidents in Indonesia, Dr. Prins demonstrates that piracy occurs in areas where there is moderate state capacity, as compared to locations where there is no state capacity or significant state capacity. This research spurred a lively conversation from the audience on how to measure state capacity, alternative explanations for piracy, and future directions for the work.

Speaking to an audience of faculty and graduate students, Dr. Uzonyi noted that, while a significant amount of research has explored why governments and rebel groups engage in civilian victimization during civil war, little is known about why third parties who have intervened in the conflict choose to target civilians. This is puzzling, as military interventions in the Syrian, Somali, and Yemeni civil wars suggest, it is not uncommon for third parties to victimize civilians in their efforts to end ongoing conflicts. Focusing specifically on pro-government military interventions, Dr. Uzonyi   s research seeks to identify what factors motivate third parties to specifically target civilians in foreign conflicts. His initial findings from a preliminary study underscore that there may be a nuanced relationship between regional or interstate rivalries (such as adversarial positions held by the USSR vs. the United States or Iran vs. Saudi Arabia) and the regime type of the intervening government. Specifically, autocratic governments that maintain multiple rivalrous relationships with other governments may use their interventions to demonstrate resolve so as to dissuade other countries from making future challenges. As these findings represent an initial step in a much larger project, Dr. Uzonyi solicited feedback from the audience on how to move forward on this novel project.","link":"http:\/\/bakercenter.utk.edu\/third-party-targeting-of-civilians-during-civil-war-since-1900\/"},{"title":"China Town Hall","content":"China Town Hall Join us for an interactive webcast on China led by Ambassador Susan Rice and an on-site discussion with Dr. William Hurst of Northwestern University.

According to the Clean Air Act, the EPA is required to determine the    best system of emission reductions    (BSER) for any air pollutant they regulate, which includes carbon dioxide. In the CPP, the EPA described three    building blocks    that make up the BSER in order for states to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The EPA set emission targets for each state based on a realistic, regionally-adjusted combination of the three building blocks. In order to comply with the CPP, states are required to develop a long-term plan for attaining their targets through incremental changes to their EGUs or clean energy development. States are encouraged to employ all three building blocks, however they may use any combination of measures, including those outside of the defined building blocks, so long as their plan demonstrates CO2 emission reductions as a state, either by rate (tons per MWh generated electricity) or total mass of CO2 (i.e., rate-base or mass-based respectively). Each state has the freedom to choose the unit of measurement for their emission reduction plan and said plan must be approved by the EPA. Compared to national 2005 levels, the CPP should result in a 32% reduction in the power sectors emissions by 2030.

Brotman sbrotman@utk.edu (865) 282-2136    The 2018 Net Vitality Index Highlights Top-Tier Leadership in Global Broadband Internet Ecosystem Development The United States and the United Kingdom retain their top-tier status from 2015  China, Germany and Canada replace South Korea, Japan, and France as leading broadband Internet ecosystem countries.    Washington, D.C., June 6, 2018   The Telecommunications Research and Policy Institute today released the full data analysis for Net Vitality 2.0  Identifying the Top-Tier Global Broadband Internet Ecosystem Leaders, the report released in March 2018 that revisits the pioneering research approach first developed in 2010 by Stuart N. Brotman, Howard Distinguished Endowed Professor of Media Management and Law  Beaman Professor of Journalism and Electronic Media, University of Tennessee, Knoxville The new report presents Brotman   s Net Vitality Index In Detail. This report is available online at  www.trpiresearch.org. The Net Vitality Index is unique as a reference tool that evaluates countries on an apples-to-apples basis, recognizing that countries are competing with each other to attract broadband Internet ecosystem talent, technology, and consumer loyalty, along with    bragging rights    that help spur broadband Internet ecosystem development even further. The Index details countries that are leading on a global basis in their deployment and use of broadband applications and content  devices  and networks. In 2018, these top-tier countries are China, the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Canada(listed by population size). Based on the original 2015 Net Vitality Index, only the United States and the United Kingdom retain their top-tier leadership status. The new report highlights that peer standing among nations must be pursued continuously, or else top-tier global broadband Internet ecosystem status may diminish over time. This composite Index reflects a portfolio of established research indices created by such organizations as the United Nations, World Economic Forum, World Wide Web Foundation, and Freedom House. The Net Vitality Index is comprised of 38 independent data sources that encompass a holistic view of broadband Internet development. It is based on the foundation of the U.S. National Broadband Plan, still in force, which envisions broadband as an interrelated ecosystem with three main elements   applications and content, devices, and networks. Additionally, the Index includes important measurements of innovation and competitiveness in recognition of their continuing linkage with global broadband Internet competitiveness The new report provides full information for all 38 indices, including where the top-tier countries rank within each of them. It also provides details regarding the methodology for creating the Net Vitality Index and links to the methodology sections of all the indices. In developing the Net Vitality Index, Professor Brotman hopes to stimulate further analysis by the research community, and to provide a more evidence-based approach for policymakers around the world who are assessing the relative strengths and weaknesses of approaches to stimulate future broadband Internet ecosystem growth. Currently, according to Professor Brotman, there is a serious disconnect between a desire to accelerate the Internet   s reach and usefulness with policy responses that look to traditional regulatory tools as primary enablers.The Net Vitality Index is designed to build bridges between researchers and policymakers by creating a necessary and more complex basis for evaluating the vitality of the broadband Internet ecosystem The Net Vitality Index underscores that governments will continue to have critical roles to play outside the regulatory process   as catalysts and challengers to the private sector.   By encouraging companies to raise their aspirations, increase the pace of innovation and the scale of investments, and move to higher levels of competitive performance,    Professor Brotman notes,    governments of the five leading Net Vitality Index countries have been able to capitalize best on the favorable attributes that each country has in place. The Net Vitality Index, in short, helps put into a global context which countries are true pacesetters in Net Vitality   the full experience of the broadband Internet ecosystem that now has such a central place in our lives at work and at home. In turn, this timely data can help in the development of future bench-marking and best practices analyses to spur even more impactful growth.    About the Author  Stuart N.

Lauren Patterson, a recent graduate of the Haslam College of Business, Global Leadership Scholar, and Baker Scholar is enjoying post graduate success as she begins working full time at the Bank of America headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina. Lauren majored in Economics with a collateral in International Business and a minor in Public Policy Analytics through the Baker Center. Growing up in Williamson County, TN, where both her parents were state employees, she    learned from an early age the importance of policy and the potential impacts of policy changes.    She further developed this interest in college through internships with a member of British Parliament and Bank of America Merrill Lynch. These experiences    reinforced my interests in the ability of the government and business to work together to make this world better.    As a Baker Scholar, Lauren decided to dive in health policy after a summer with Bank of America, where she    worked with the healthcare team that analyzes and underwrites loans for large healthcare corporations.    In her thesis research, which can be found here, Lauren examined    how the number of plans offered and firms in a set market, plan pricing components, and country health variables impact monthly premium pricing for plans sold on the individual market.    The creation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which required private insurers to insure everyone who applied, charge the same premiums to people of the same age, and cover pre-existing conditions, ultimately aimed to increase the insured rate. However, some of the ACA regulations led to    heterogeneous risk pools   , meaning that people paid equal premiums regardless of their risk. Lauren observed that when risk pools are not separated,    the premium for that pool will rise over time due to the high-risk payers making significantly more costly claims.    Due to the increasing premiums, healthy enrollees, exited the market. Additionally, as more regulations on insurance companies were created, many private firms pulled out of ACA insurance exchanges, which left some markets with only one insurer. In Lauren   s research, she also analyzed how consolidation of insurers or low competition affects premium costs. Lauren used an ordinary least squares regression to analyze the relationship between premium prices and the number of plans sold while accounting for    country health variables and other insurance plan pricing components.    Through her research, Lauren found that a maximum out of pocket price, the rate of excess drinking, and the unemployment rate had the largest effect on premium price. Additionally, she found that    more plans in a market are associated with lower premium prices,    which supports other research in the field. For Lauren, the most interesting finding was how risk pools and the theory of competition with price interact. She found that premium costs weren   t only impacted by the number of plans available or the number of firms in a market, because the two interact to create price changes in the market. The Baker Scholars program and project helped Lauren see what interested her in the realm of public policy. While Lauren was always interested in health and healthcare policy, she sees it    more as a calling than an interest    now. After a few years working as a full-time analyst with the Bank of America, Lauren may consider pursuing a doctorate degree in Economics.

Photographs of migrants and refugees arriving on European shores became viral on social media and produced a global reaction. Some were concerned about the economic and cultural effects the rapid influx of migrants would have, and some were concerned for the well-being of war torn and desperate people. Over time, the crisis fostered a general disdain or skepticism towards migrants from Muslim-majority countries. The European migrant crisis controlled the media for months and was a main topic of conversation internationally. While not entirely true, the media promoted the impression that Europe absorbed the majority of migrants from conflict areas. Data shows that Middle Eastern countries are actually receiving far more migrants than Europe, though this goes largely unnoticed. Two University of Tennessee professors, Baker Center Faculty Fellow Dr. Matt Buehler and assistant professor of Political Science Dr. Joon Han, are working in collaboration with Harvard professor Dr. Kristin Fabbe to conduct a nationally representative poll in Morocco investigating xenophobic attitudes against both Arab and Sub-Saharan African refugees. This research originated as a pilot study funded by the Howard H. Baker Jr. Center for Public Policy, which analyzed the attitudes of ordinary citizens towards Sub-Saharan African and Arab refugees. However, this research focused only on the Casablanca region of Morocco. To continue this research, Dr. Buehler and Dr. Han recently received a much larger grant from Harvard University   s Middle East Initiative at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, which does research in contemporary politics in the Middle East. This grant will allow for a nationally representative survey. It is no surprise that the Syrian civil war is contributing to the refugee crisis, but in Morocco, only approximately 20% of migrants come from Syria, with the remaining 80% coming from Sub-Saharan Africa. The makeup of the refugee population in Morocco is drastically different from some of its neighbors in the Middle East. For example, in Lebanon, close to 95% of refugees come from Syria. While it can be assumed that crisis is the primary cause of the influx of refugees to Libya or Lebanon, because of the large population of African migrants, the same cannot be said for Morocco. There is a level of conflict in Africa to consider  however, climate change, poverty, and a myriad of other issues can lead to migration. It is important to understand why migration occurs and what drives refugee movement, but this research does not seek to analyze the root of migration, but rather, why host countries and citizens have xenophobic attitudes towards migrants. Xenophobia stems from many things, such as differences in language, religion, labor market competition, or involvement in crime. However,, many of the fears or concerns regarding migrants are based on stereotypes. The survey will primarily address why there is such a strong opposition toward migrants particularly from Sub-Saharan Africa. In most cases, Middle Eastern host countries are rather supportive and empathetic toward migrants from other Middle Eastern countries. In order to gather the most accurate understanding of xenophobia in the Middle East, Dr. Han and Dr. Buehler will carry out a national poll. The most important factor in a successful national poll is random sampling, which ensures that everyone in the population has an equal chance of being surveyed. For their research, Dr. Han and Dr. Buehler will employ multi-stage probability sampling design. Essentially, the team will begin by randomly choosing an upper-level administrative district and continue choosing lower level districts until a housing block, followed by a household, and a person are randomly selected. This process is repeated until a desired number of people have been polled in any given district of Morocco. While Dr. Buehler and Dr. Han will collaborate with a local survey firm to carry out the polling, they have been instrumental in creating the survey. Similar to studies regarding attitudes towards immigration in Western Europe, this poll will include diverse questions that will gauge local views on immigration. First, to determine the respondents general view on immigration, they are asked whether they believe there are too many or too few immigrants in the country. Next, there are a series of questions meant to determine what fuels any present xenophobic attitudes  economic, cultural, of security threats. Then, respondents are asked about the qualifications of immigrants  such as race, language, education, etc. This answer will reveal what bothers native people about immigrants. Finally, there a number of questions regarding specific types of immigrants and specific immigration policies. Since this research has been done on a smaller scale, Dr. Buehler already has some idea of the general attitudes towards immigrants and refugees in Morocco. Unlike in Europe, where cultural differences are the main trigger for xenophobia, in Morocco, people are most concerned with economics. Religion and language are not as important to native people, likely because the culture differences are not as stark to Moroccans as they are in European countries. There are many economic issues that fuel aversion toward immigrants. However, Dr. Han, whose research interests include the political economic effects of immigration, pointed out that there are gaps between perception and reality when it comes to the economic impacts of immigration. For example, many people assume that increased immigration will put a strain on the labor market. This is easy to believe because supply and demand would constitute that as more people compete for jobs, fewer jobs become available. However, this is not necessarily the case. While immigrants may take some jobs from the native population, this allows a business to employ cheaper workers and thus expand. Additionally, the strain on the labor market is felt by foreign workers instead of native workers. Many isolated labor markets are dominated by foreign workers, such as heavy labor or agriculture. Foreign labor dominates these industries because employers cannot find native workers willing to take these jobs. Within these labor markets, increased immigration actually put a strain on other foreign employees, not the job-seeking native population. Additionally, many empirical studies found that increased immigration reduces the wages of foreign workers, not native workers. Another common belief regarding immigration is that immigrants are eligible for social benefits and they increase the tax burden on the native population. Similar to the labor market misconceptions, this belief is not entirely true either. Many immigrants are usually allowed to receive social benefits, but they are also required to pay taxes. This proves to be a benefit to the host country because    population aging    has made excessive demands on taxpayers.    Population aging    refers to the principle that there are not enough young, working, taxpayers to provide for the increasing number of retirees receiving benefits. Immigration is actually quite beneficial in aging societies because they provide a financial cushion and alleviate the pressure on native taxpayers. Overall, most empirical research demonstrates that the financial effect of immigration is marginal. While findings do not support the perceived economic effect of immigration, it is still a major factor in xenophobic attitudes. While fear and concern regarding immigration is not a foreign concept to the United States, there are still many differences between the manifestation of xenophobia in each respective country. The U.S. was a country founded by immigrants and traditionally accepts them, but Morocco is not. Historically, Morocco has generated immigrants. Although this study has no crucial implications regarding xenophobia in the United States, as the context is vastly different, this research will provide valuable information for the United States in terms of National security. Understanding how xenophobia manifests in the Middle East will allow policy and security professionals to predict how changes in immigration affect stability in the region. Morocco is a major non-NATO ally for the United States and it is vital that our leaders understand this region for our anti-terrorism and other security efforts. Additionally, this research can be widely beneficial for other middle eastern countries, who also deal with high levels of immigration.

Baker Jr. Center for Public Policy  Celebrates its 10 Year Anniversary","content":"The Howard H. Baker Jr. Center for Public Policy Celebrates its 10 Year Anniversary Over the past ten years the Baker Center has cultivated a community of students and faculty who honor the legacy of Senator Howard Baker. The Baker Center houses the Modern Political Archives, Chancellor   s Honors Program, and the Masters of Public Policy and Administration. Through public lectures and programs within the three focus areas of Energy and Environment, Global Security, and Leadership and Governance, the Center encourages students and community members to to engage in the political system and to serve our local, state, national, and global communities. To celebrate our 10 successful years, we asked our students to reflect on their time at the Baker Center and the impact the Center and faculty have had on their college careers. Bailee Beshires, a senior Baker Ambassador, said that being involved with the Baker Center has been the most impactful experience in her three years of college.    What drew me to this program was the emphasis on nonpartisanship and civility, but the reason I stayed involved here is because of the remarkable staff that have become my mentors and biggest support system. Through the Baker Ambassador program, I   ve been able to meet and build relationships with some of the most inspiring people, including Cissy Baker, who truly mimic the character of Senator Baker.    Recent graduate and Fulbright Scholar, Avanti Rangnekar, had this to  say about her experience as a Baker Scholar     I could never have achieved what I have without the community and support that I received from the Baker Center staff and Baker Scholars. It   s a support system that I will forever be grateful for and that I will certainly be visiting whenever I come back to visit Rocky Top!    Jay Hearn, a senior Baker Ambassador, says his time at the Baker Center has left a positive impact on his time at the University of Tennessee.  From being a member of the Baker Center LLC as a freshman to being a Baker Ambassador to being the head of Roosevelt @ UTK, a public policy think tank on campus, none of this could ve happened without the wonderful staff and resources available through the Baker Center. If you at all care about civility, public service, policy, and government, the Baker Center will be a home for you on campus. It s been mine for three years and I m truly grateful to be part of the legacy of Howard Baker.  Lawand Yaseen, a sophomore Baker Ambassador, said,    As a first-year Baker Ambassador, I had the opportunity to learn, serve, and connect with both students and faculty who exemplify the attributes of the man that the Center honors, Senator Howard Baker. Even while being an Engineering major, assisting in events and panels has ignited a passion for educating both the student body and the local community about pertinent national and international policy.    Katherine Harwell, a participant in the Baker Center   s inaugural Washington Program says,    The program was such a unique experience. From the Supreme Court to the EPA, we really got an inside peek at all that Washington has to offer. Spending time in D.C. with my peers was incredibly formative and gave me a needed sense of direction for the rest of my undergraduate and graduate studies. I   m so thankful the Baker Center gave me this opportunity.  Senior Baker Ambassador, Greta Roberts, said her involvement at the Baker Center has benefited her in numerous ways.    Upon entering college, I possessed little direction as to what path I wanted my academic career to take  however all of this changed once I became involved with the Baker Center. Being involved with the Center since my freshman year has provided me with countless opportunities to grow in my academic and professional life. I m so grateful for all of the knowledge I have acquired and the people I have had the pleasure to meet through the Baker Center.    Ricky Goyette, a recent graduate of the Minor in Public Policy Analytics, a Baker Ambassador, and current research assistant at the Baker Center says that his time with the Baker Center was the most  impactful during his time at UT.    Serving with the Baker Ambassadors allowed me to meet so many other students who were interested in policy and service, and it seriously helped me in my professional development. Minoring in Public Policy Analytics allowed me to solidify and expand my research abilities further than I thought I would be able to. I can say with certainty that I am the student and professional I am today because of my time with the Baker Center.
