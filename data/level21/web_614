     The Economic Science Laboratory is located on the ground floor of McClelland Hall.
     <br>
      The lab hosts a diverse group of researchers who are interested in experimentally exploring how people make economic and social decisions.
      <br>
       <br>
        You have the opportunity to earn money from participating in these researchers' experiments.
        <br>
         <br>
          In a typical experiment, you and other participants interact in a strategic game with each other via computers.  Your earnings are based on the decisions that you and the other participants make in the game.  In addition, you are guaranteed to make a certain amount from showing up on time.  You are typically paid in cash at the end of each experiment. Experiments generally last between 30 and 90 minutes.
          <br>
           <br>
            After you register, our researchers will send you invitations to schedule experiments. Details about each experiment — what you have to do, how you will be paid based on your decisions, and so on — are given out by the researchers at the start of each experimental session.
            <br>
             <br/>
             All participation is voluntary and the risks are minimal.
             <br/>
             The University of Arizona's Institutional Review Board has approved the experiments and their methodology.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Sometimes our researchers will request personal information for financial and tax purposes.  Unless otherwise mentioned, this information will NOT be used for research purposes and CANNOT be linked to the decisions that you made during the experiment.  Every effort will be made to maintain the confidentiality of your personal information.

   <h2>
    Privacy Policy
   </h2>
   We respect your privacy and we take every effort to maintain it.
   <br>
    <br>
     We often collect two different kinds of data from you: personal data and experimental data.
     <br/>
     •   Personal data incudes your name, age, sex, address, phone number, email, and social security number.
     <br/>
     •   Experimental data includes the decisions that you made during the experiment and your outcome in the experiment.
     <br/>
     Personal data is collected for administrative and tax reasons. Experimental data is collected for research purposes.  Both types of data will be stored indefinitely in a secure location on campus.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Unless you consent, these two kinds of data are kept separate.  This means that your personal data
     <b>
      cannot
     </b>
     be linked to the decisions that you've made during the experiment.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Sometimes a researcher may ask you to allow some of your personal information to be linked to your experimental information.  For instance, a researcher may ask you whether your age and sex may be linked to your experimental information. It is your choice as to whether or not to allow this information to be linked to your experimental information.  If you refuse, you retain all the money that you have earned up to that point in the experiment.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     We will
     <b>
      never
     </b>
     sell your e-mail address, phone number, or other personal information.  We will
     <b>
      never
     </b>
     make your personal data available to the public.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     We
     <b>
      will
     </b>
     also use your email address to inform you of new opportunities to participate in experiments.  You may opt out of receiving e-mail from us by updating the settings in your account profile.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     We
     <b>
      will
     </b>
     use your personal information for tax and administrative purposes.  We will also use your experimental information for research purposes.  Additionally, regulatory agencies or other oversight bodies may review your experimental information. Since experiments often occur with groups, other people may know that you've participated.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     We may occasionally update our Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices. If we make material changes in the way we collect, use, or share your personal information, we will notify you and/or prominently post notices of the changes on our website.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     By participating in experiments at the Economic Sciences Laboratory, you warrant that you have read this policy and consent to it.
