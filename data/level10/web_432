    Welcome to the My Network website!
   </h1>
  </center>
  <p>
   This website is currently in the beta phase. As such, there may be some bugs to iron out.
  </p>
  <p>
   Quick Notes:
   <pre>   There is currently limited help documentation on the scripts. 
        However, we are working on putting these together.  Once the help files/tutorials
        have been completed, they will be made accesible on the main My Network portal.
	
	Remember... have fun and be sure to report any bugs/comments to the NOC.
