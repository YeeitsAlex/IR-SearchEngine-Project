            At MITdesignX, IP is considered the property of the individuals and/or teams. MIT will not stake IP or patent claims to new ideas developed at MITdesignX. If your idea was created as part of prior research at MIT, or uses specific lab support of MIT, then MIT IP may apply. Teams must clear any MIT IP issues with the MIT TLO. Work by faculty or staff of MIT may also be subject to MIT rules pertaining to IP. The program offers resources to assist you in protecting and filing patents.

           In this new spring subject, you will engage the fantastical side of architecture and explore how technology can convert
          </span>
          “futuristic visions” of design into reality.  Working in groups and within the framework of two specific, yet broad, practice sectors: aviation and healthcare, students will envision and prototype specific design elements and/or systems that can radically change the way buildings operate and interact with people and the environment.
         </p>
         <p>
          Today, with novel materials, embedded computation, AI and robotics we can go even further to rethink the ordinary and every day in architecture and make it enchanted — to radically reimagine the built environment.
         </p>
         <p>
          In addition to the instructors, students will interact with leaders from Gensler’s aviation and healthcare sectors who will bring experience and insight from relevant projects and research to provide real context for their visions.

       At MITdesignX, IP is considered the property of the individuals and/or teams. MIT will not stake IP or patent claims to new ideas developed at MITdesignX. If your idea was created as part of prior research at MIT, or uses specific lab support of MIT, then MIT IP may apply. Teams must clear any MIT IP issues with the MIT TLO. Work by faculty or staff of MIT may also be subject to MIT rules pertaining to IP. The program offers resources to assist you in protecting and filing patents.

       Teams will only be eligible for funding after the midterm break of the Spring semester, and upon incorporation of their business venture. If a venture is not ready for incorporation at that time, incremental payments can be advanced to your team during the Spring term in the form of reimbursements or payments of accepted expenses. The discretion for advanced funding will rest solely with the executive director of MITdesignX.

      In this new spring subject, you will engage the fantastical side of architecture and explore how technology can convert
     </span>
     “futuristic visions” of design into reality.  Working in groups and within the framework of two specific, yet broad, practice sectors: aviation and healthcare, students will envision and prototype specific design elements and/or systems that can radically change the way buildings operate and interact with people and the environment.
    </p>
    <p>
     Today, with novel materials, embedded computation, AI and robotics we can go even further to rethink the ordinary and every day in architecture and make it enchanted — to radically reimagine the built environment.
    </p>
    <p>
     In addition to the instructors, students will interact with leaders from Gensler’s aviation and healthcare sectors who will bring experience and insight from relevant projects and research to provide real context for their visions.

       The first step of the framework is to
      </span>
      <b>
       understand
      </b>
      <span style="font-weight: 400;">
       the need or problem the new venture is being designed to
      </span>
      <b>
       solve
      </b>
      <span style="font-weight: 400;">
       . The teams engage directly with people and stakeholders to learn as much as possible about who they are, and what are their needs and pain points. Based on that understanding, the second step is to clearly define the core concept/function/product/service that will provide the required
      </span>
      <b>
       solution
      </b>
      <span style="font-weight: 400;">

      </span>
      <b>
       envision
      </b>
      <span style="font-weight: 400;">
       what the venture and its founders want to achieve, and define the fundamental principles that will guide their decision making, development and operations including financing of the venture. The fourth and final step is focused on developing a master plan of priorities, people, processes and funds needed to effectively
      </span>
      <b>
       scale
      </b>
      <span style="font-weight: 400;">
       and launch the venture.

     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span style="font-weight: 400;">
       At the end of the program, all teams will have developed a prototype, investor pitch deck and a “masterplan” for their venture – outlining key actions and strategies. The accelerator program culminates with a pitch night for teams to introduce their ventures to hundreds of investors, stakeholders, civic and industry partners.

the opinion of a \u2018bandhu\u2019 (in Hindi, this translates to friend\/brother\/relative) who is living in an urban area and can offer them access to a job or an initial place of stay. The other dominant mode is to trust the verbal promises of a \u2018labor contractor\u2019 (job broker) who offers low\/moderate wage labor jobs, with an assurance of providing or finding housing. While the system has long functioned like this, and has benefited these labor contractors, it clearly has not been fair to the vast majority \u2013 the seasonal migrant workers.<\/p>\n<p class=\"Default\">Even if a migrant is able to secure stable employment, dignified affordable housing in urban areas is hard to find and, if found, it is hard to get long-term security of tenure. This market of informal real estate is also captured by middlemen. Furthermore, urban employers constantly face problems when seeking appropriately skilled blue-collar workers and are also largely reliant on these labor contractors.<\/p>\n<p class=\"Default\">The entire process of choosing to migrate is full of blind turns, with no single entity having perspective on the entire chain. One wrong step for a low wage worker can have serious lifelong consequences.<\/p>\n<p class=\"Default\">Our mobile phone platform &#8211; \u00a0\u2018Bandhu\u2019 &#8211; minimizes these information asymmetries so that low-income migrants can make migration decisions with assurance. It does so by creating matches between employers looking for low\/moderate skill workers, potential migrants\/workers, and owners\/occupants offering informal affordable housing on rent. By providing the potential migrants with competing offers of bundled Employment and Housing, for similar wage differentials*, the \u2018Bandhu\u2019 platform can minimize risks for the worker while still leaving the final choice up to him or her.<\/p>\n"}]},"link":"https:\/\/designx.mit.edu\/venture_team\/bandhu\/","image":false},{"ID":629,"post_author":"6","post_date":"2018-12-19

The creation of a local mutual credit system increases users purchasing and saving power because, as a complement for trading, they can use the local credit to buy within the local market and reserve national currency to either save, invest, or spend outside of the community.<\/p>\n<p>Quipu operates on a web based and app platform that takes advantage of the high penetration of smartphone and internet in informal settlements (75% penetration in Latin America). We aim to be a disruptive digital tool to build economic justice in communities of the Global South by fusing technological innovations like blockchain with grassroots-community-organizing in order to alleviate some of the pressing market failures that plague such communities. The app improves a seller\u2019s management and visibility, helps organize collective buying from suppliers and\/or replace imports with local production, and create new associations between shoppers in the same industries. The registered transactions between users are then used to create a financial score within Quipu that can enable access to bank loans to empower their businesses or improve their living conditions in the long term, incentivizing the use of Quipu.<\/p>\n"}]},"link":"https:\/\/designx.mit.edu\/venture_team\/quipu\/","image":false},{"ID":640,"post_author":"6","post_date":"2018-12-19
