                 Are you interested in learning how to make your communication pleasurable, relevant, organized, and thematic? According to Freeman Tilden, information, as such, is not interpretation.  Interpretation is revelation based upon information. Interpretation involves translating technical language into terms that people can readily understand.  Interpretation stresses the importance of ideas and relationships rather than facts and figures.
                </p>
                <p>
                 This course is designed to give West Virginia guides, educators, and anyone interested in increasing the effectiveness of their communication the knowledge and skills needed to engage people in a positive and constructive way with West Virginia resources. The course will provide training on effective interpretation techniques, which will contribute to more effective communication with the visitor.
                </p>
                <p>
                 <span style="line-height: 1.231;">
                  The online portion of the course consists of five units.  Upon completing the online portion of the course, you will have a working plan for a 10-minute interpretive talk. You will give your interpretive talk during a half-day, in-person workshop held shortly after the online course. The in-person workshop will be led by WVU faculty.
                 </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                 A $50 fee is required to participate in this course which goes to cover travel costs for the instructors for the in-person workshop.  Once payment has been received a code will be sent to the participant to receive access to the online course.  It is recommended that a group of guides take the course together to increase the effectiveness of the in-person assessment.
                </p>

                  The WV Annie’s Project is a holistic risk-management educational program for WV women in agriculture, which provides risk-management education, coaching/mentoring assistance, and networking opportunities designed to increase the number of women leading profitable agribusinesses in WV. Annie’s Project will give West Virginia women producers the tools to help them become better risk takers and risk managers by focusing on five areas of farm risk – production risk, marketing and pricing risk, financial risk, human and personal risk, and legal risk. We provide in-depth risk management training in business planning, record keeping, financial analysis, farm and food safety, and networking – participants learned how to evaluate business expansion/diversification opportunities and determine their costs and returns; identify farm/food safety risks and develop farm/food safety plans; and develop business plans and conduct farm financial analyses. Methodologies employed in this program are based on female producers’ preferred learning styles – providing simple, user-friendly information in a participatory, conversational setting; learning basic business skills from their peers; educational activities involving an exchange of ideas with other women; and training opportunities promoting interaction and communication.
