     Population Index
    </i>
    , published between 1937 and 1999, was the primary reference tool to the world's population literature. It presented an annotated bibliography of recently published books, journal articles, working papers, and other materials on population topics. This website provides a searchable and browsable database containing 46,035 abstracts of demographic literature published in Population Index in the period 1986-2000. The complete journal collection going back to the 1930s is available in
    <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/i369240">
     JSTOR
    </a>
    . This website is organized in three major sections:

 datasets are not available in this CD or from the website.
