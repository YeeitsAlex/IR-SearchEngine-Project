       2019-01-18 EU bug bounty for finding vulnerabilities in PuTTY
      </b>
      <p>
       From now until 7th March, you can earn money by reporting security
vulnerabilities in PuTTY!
       <p>
        HackerOne is running a
        <a href="https://hackerone.com/putty_h1c">

bounty programme
        </a>
        for PuTTY, funded by the European Union as part
of the ‘Free and Open Source Software Audit’ project
(EU-FOSSA 2). If you report a vulnerability through their web site, it
may qualify for a bounty. (The exact amount will depend on how serious
the problem is, and there's also a bonus for providing a patch that
fixes it.)
        <p>
         For more details, or if you have something to report, see the link
above.
         <p>

reported
          <em>
           to them

                PuTTY 0.69, released today, fixes further problems with Windows DLL

                 <p>
                  PuTTY 0.68, released today, supports elliptic-curve cryptography for
host keys, user authentication keys, and key exchange. Also, for the
first time, it comes in a 64-bit Windows version.
                  <p>
                   0.68 also contains some security fixes: a vulnerability in agent
forwarding is fixed, and Windows DLL hijacking should no longer be
possible.

                     2017-01-21 Win64 builds and website redesign

                    <p>
                     We're now offering 64-bit Windows builds of PuTTY, alongside the
32-bit ones we've always provided.
                     <p>
                      Right now, the 64-bit builds work as far as we know, but they haven't
had as much testing as the 32-bit ones. So we're still considering the
32-bit builds to be more likely to be stable. However, if you have any
reason to want to use a 64-bit build (e.g. it needs to load a 64-bit
supporting DLL for something like GSSAPI), or if you just feel like
trying out the new builds, then please let us know if you have any
trouble.
                      <p>
                       We've also redesigned our website. The old Download page isn't there
any more: instead, we have separate pages for the
                       <a href="latest.html">
                        latest release

                       and the
                       <a href="snapshot.html">
                        development snapshots
                       </a>
                       .
Also, you can find past release builds of PuTTY by following links
from the
                       <a href="changes.html">
                        Changes page

                       ,
in case those are useful to you. (However, most of them have known
vulnerabilities these days; we don't recommend you use any vulnerable
past release if you can avoid it.)

                        <p>
                         We're switching to the MSI format for PuTTY's Windows installer
(generated by the
                         <a href="http://wixtoolset.org/">
                          WiX toolset
                         </a>
                         ).
                         <p>
                          Mostly this is because of the
                          <a href="https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/134694/jrsoft-dllhijack.txt">
                           report
                          </a>
                          late last year that Windows installers created by Inno Setup are
vulnerable to being hijacked by particular DLLs left in the same
directory (such as your browser downloads directory).
                          <p>
                           However, MSI also provides some other useful features, including
automated silent install/uninstall via
                           <code>
                            msiexec /q
                           </code>
                           , and
also the ability to automatically put the PuTTY install directory on
the
                           <code>
                            PATH
                           </code>
                           so that Command Prompts can run PSCP without any
fuss.
                           <p>
                            The development snapshots will now have MSI installers, and we have
also retrospectively generated an MSI installer for the recent 0.67
release. Sorry we didn't have it ready in time – MSI is quite
complicated if you're not an expert, and it took a long time to get it
to work!
                            <p>
                             For the moment, we're still providing Inno Setup installers as well,
in case anyone has trouble with our new and not-very-tested MSIs. But
we recommend that people use the MSI if possible, and if you must use
the Inno Setup installer, make sure to put it in an empty directory
before running it.

                                            We've had several reports recently of anti-virus software reporting
PuTTY as malware (under a wide variety of names, often generic). This
affects the latest release (0.64) and also the development snapshots
(particularly puttygen.exe).
                                            <p>
                                             We believe these are false positives. In those cases where we've been
able to contact the vendor (McAfee, Symantec, ClamAV), they have
removed the detection.
                                             <p>
                                              However, most vendors' false-positive response is to whitelist
specific binaries. While this will resolve detections of the 0.64
release, expect detections to recur with the development snapshots,
which are built daily.
                                              <p>
                                               We've had no success requesting AV software vendors to perform more
in-depth analysis. If this is causing trouble for you, and you have a
support contract with your AV vendor, please query the detection with
them directly.
