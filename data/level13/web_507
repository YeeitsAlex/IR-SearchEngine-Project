                , San Francisco State University remains united as a community of learners in our passion for academic excellence, intellectual discovery, creative and critical inquiry, and educational equity. SF State maintains a proud history of commitment to social justice and opposition to oppression and marginalization, which lives on through the work, scholarship and community engagement of its students, faculty, staff and alumni.
               </p>
               <p>
                Emerging from SF State’s proud history and long-standing commitments to teaching, learning and social justice, our strategic plan is anchored by five core University values: Courage, Life of the Mind, Equity, Community and Resilience. Please click on the tabs below to see the significant progress we have made with the strategic plan.

                    At SF State, diversity and pluralism form the conditions of intellectual advancement, creativity and innovation. As we work with students to prepare for life and work in a complex and increasingly transnational society, and seek to expand the boundaries of human understanding through our scholarly work, SF State is well positioned for the educational challenges of the 21st century.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    In June of 2013, President Wong appointed the Strategic Planning Coordinating Committee (SPCC) and charged the committee to conduct a broad-based and collaborative strategic planning effort to establish SF State’s institutional priorities for the years ahead. The charge to the planning committee identified seven themes: Building the San Francisco State Identity, Maximizing Student Success, the Academic Master Plan, the Physical Master Plan, Advancing Campus &amp; Community Climate, Elevating Institutional Support, and Emerging Issues. Those themes served as points of entry to engage the campus and community, and subcommittees explored those themes in detail during the 2013-2014 academic year. Theme subcommittees engaged the campus and community through a variety of ways including special events, meetings with key stakeholders and campus groups, social media and a customized platform (at Neighborland.com). In June 2014, the subcommittees detailed their findings and insights in reports that were shared with the campus community.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    During the summer of 2014, the SPCC analyzed the theme subcommittee reports and released a draft strategic plan. The SPCC then solicited feedback on the draft plan through the Make Your Mark event and through conversations with various groups and stakeholders. That feedback yielded numerous improvements, and the SPCC is thankful that SF State’s new strategic plan benefits from the generosity of students, colleagues and friends who have shared what they care about, the challenges they face and their strategies for overcoming them.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Emerging from the University’s long-standing commitments to teaching, learning and social justice, the new strategic plan is anchored by five core University values: Courage, Life of the Mind, Equity, Community and Resilience. The plan highlights aspirations and objectives within each of those core value areas, and it offers initiatives to deliver on the objectives. The strategic plan and all of its components should be read within the ongoing context of our institutional commitment to shared governance. The new strategic plan establishes our institutional priorities.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The initiatives offered by the plan promise to advance these priorities. These initiatives are ambitious. They reflect a collaborative spirit that will strengthen our community while we identify new ways to think and work together. The success of the plan rests upon the talented community of people who are SF State. The plan will serve as a living document that offers direction and inspiration to our future leadership without overly proscribing the outcome of our shared decision-making.

                   <p>
                    Courage follows from and enables principle. Courage propels our willingness to be different and unique--to establish ourselves as a university with a distinct mission and character, rather than a follower in the pattern of others. Courage allows us to hold difficult conversations in broad forums and undergirds our commitment to social justice, to shared governance, to academic freedom and to student, faculty and staff activism. Courage recognizes that innovation involves risk and failure, and it embraces change and adversity as opportunities. Courage fortifies our efforts to question conventional wisdom and explore controversial issues in the name of deeper understanding; it energizes our commitment to academic freedom. We celebrate people of intellect and humanity who take positions of principle and stand by them despite academic and social pressure. Courageous scholars form fruitful and respectful partnerships with local and international communities while submitting academic insights to the test of practice, forming new knowledge. The courageous are aware of their vulnerabilities, but they are not resigned to victimization. Courage creates the condition and chief outcome of an education of substance--the ability to "own one's own mind."

                    By definition, the University is an intellectual community that aspires to encompass the richness and breadth of human knowledge. SF State’s academic mission advances a distinct commitment to critical and collaborative thought, intellectual pluralism and action. SF State’s faculty are both dedicated teachers and engaged professional practitioners and scholars; teaching is enlivened by faculty who create new knowledge in their academic fields, professional practice and community engagement, while faculty research and practice are sharpened and their stakes clarified through the privilege of teaching new skills to students at all levels. We embrace a reciprocal relationship between the University and the world and between experience and knowledge that is captured by our motto, “Experientia Docet.” We value learning that is not bounded by the classroom, archive or campus but takes place in myriad forms and locations. We nourish and recognize intellectual achievement across a range of academic, creative and professional spheres, both traditional and forward-looking. And we affirm the life of the mind as a continued source of meaning, purpose and commitment for all members of our intellectual community.

                    Resilience is the ability to recover and adapt quickly to difficulty or challenges and transform adversity into opportunity. It is a quality enhanced by intentional planning premised on the socio-cultural, environmental and economic systems of sustainability, and it is magnified by the ability to anticipate challenges that lie ahead. As the pace and unpredictability of change accelerate in the 21st century, resilience is increasingly indispensable. In this climate, a quality higher education that promotes radical and nimble thinking fosters resilience in people and families. We also recognize that we play a central role in the resilience of our community and the world, not only as the result of the contributions that our graduates make, but through our scholarship, activism and community-engaged work. As we confront such problems as environmental sustainability and climate change in our classrooms and labs, we recognize our responsibility to help forge resilience in the communities we serve.

The Quality Assurance Team has launched a DocuSign pilot program to assess how electronic signatures can facilitate making business processes more streamlined and user friendly. This initiative has prompted departments to reevaluate their forms and processes for improved clarity and reduced processing time. Electronic signatures will lower transaction costs, enhance productivity and increase employee satisfaction.

                          Information Technology Services’ Common Network Initiative (CNI) is an ongoing effort to maintain campus baseline network infrastructure as technology advances and user needs evolve. The program refreshes the campus network infrastructure on a cyclical basis. Major milestones include installing parallel infrastructure, performing campus data center network equipment updates, tracing and replacing network cables and gear in all telecommunications rooms, and completing wireless core infrastructure upgrade. Currently the University is in Phase 4 of its upgrades. (See notes under Courage.)
