     The basic goal of our research is to investigate how humans learn and
      reason, and how intelligent machines might emulate them. In tasks that
      arise both in childhood (e.g., perceptual learning and language acquisition)
      and in adulthood (e.g., action understanding and analogical inference),
      humans often paradoxically succeed in making inferences from inadequate
      data. The data available are often sparse (very few examples), ambiguous
      (multiple possible interpretations), and noisy (low signal-to-noise ratio).
      How can an intelligent system cope?
    </p>
    <p>
     We approach this basic question as it arises in both perception and
        higher cognition. Our research is highly interdisciplinary, integrating
        theories and methods from psychology, statistics, computer vision, machine
        learning, and computational neuroscience. The unified picture emerging
        from our work is that the power of human inference depends on two basic
        principles. First, people exploit generic priors — tacit general
        assumptions about the way the world works, which guide learning and inference
        from observed data. Second, people have a capacity to generate and manipulate
        structured representations— representations organized around distinct
        roles, such as multiple joints in motion with respect to one another
        in action perception. Our current areas of active study include action
        understanding, motion perception, object recognition, causal learning,
        and analogical reasoning. See the list of ongoing
        research projects on the research page.
