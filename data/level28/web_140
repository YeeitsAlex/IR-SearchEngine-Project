    <em>
     The Deal of the Century: The Break Up of AT&amp;T
    </em>

   <p>
    In 2000, UofC alumnus Robert Vare (A.B. ’67, A.M. ’70) approached
John Boyer, the Dean of the College, with the idea of starting a
Writer-in-Residence position at The University of Chicago expressly
devoted to nonfiction.
   </p>
   <p>
    Chicago has had numerous writers-in-residence over the years–in
fiction, poetry, and playwriting—but this was the first time that the
university had given this kind of recognition to nonfiction writing as
an intellectual discipline and art form.
   </p>
   <p>
    The program, which operates under the aegis of the Committee on
Creative Writing, brings to campus a different nonfiction writer of
unusual accomplishment every academic year to teach one writing course
for one quarter. The syllabus, structure, and content of the course is
entirely up to the individual writers-in-residence, though all courses
have a strong workshop component and provide students with
opportunities for significant hands-on writing experience. While on
campus, Vare Writers-in-Residence are encouraged to make full use of
campus resources and to participate in the University community.
   </p>
   <p>
    The program has proven to be a great success with students and
faculty, as well as with rotating writers-in-residence themselves.
Previous writers-in-residence have noted how gifted and highly
motivated their Chicago students have been. David Hajdu called them the
best he’d ever taught and described Chicago as “the fulfillment of my
dream vision of what a great university is.”
