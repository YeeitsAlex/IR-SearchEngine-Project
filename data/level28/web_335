             In daily information sessions, admissions staff provide an overview of Duke for an audience of high school students, transfer candidates and their families. They also describe -- and answer questions about -- academic opportunities, student life, the undergraduate admissions process and financing a Duke education.
            </p>
            <p>
             Information sessions are normally held in McClendon Commons, adjacent to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions, located on West Campus near the traffic circle at 2138 Campus Drive. Sessions are immediately followed by student-led walking tours of campus. In addition to seeing campus facilities, you'll have a chance to hear about Duke from a student's perspective. Tours typically last between an hour and fifteen minutes and an hour and a half. Please call ahead if you require accommodations or will require physical assistance during a tour of campus.
            </p>
            <p>
             We offer campus tours based on the availability of our student tour guides and strongly recommend you plan to visit when students are on campus. We are also happy to provide you with maps and other information for self-guided campus tours. If you arrive on campus outside of our regular office hours, you will find a kiosk with these materials outside the front door.

    Visiting Tips
   </h4>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Reservations are required to attend any of our regularly scheduled information sessions and campus tours.
    </li>
    <li>
     Arrive at least 30 minutes prior to the start of the information session for which you've registered.
    </li>
    <li>
     Allow additional time to explore campus on your own. Talk with students and find out about their Duke experiences.
    </li>
    <li>
     "Demonstrated interest," the amount of contact between an individual and our admissions office, is not a factor in our admissions process.
    </li>
    <li>
     Because of the high volume of visitors, admissions officers are unable to schedule individual appointments with prospective students.

     Where to Park
    </h4>
    <p>
     Visitors to our office should plan to arrive about 30 minutes prior to the beginning of the information session or tour they plan to attend, in order to allow adequate time for parking.
    </p>
    <p>
     There is a limited number of free parking spaces for visitors in the circular drive in the front of the
     <a href="http://maps.duke.edu/map/index.php?id=21&amp;embedMrkId=2768&amp;mapOnly=1">
      Office of Undergraduate Admissions
     </a>
     . However, visitors who park in these spaces need a permit, available at the admissions office reception desk.
    </p>
    <p>
     There are additional spaces in the circular drive behind McClendon Commons, located immediately adjacent to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions. During peak times, many of our visitors will need to park in either the Sarah P. Duke Gardens lot or the Nasher Museum of Art lot. It takes approximately five to ten minutes to walk from one of these lots to our office, so please be sure to allow yourself adequate time.
    </p>
    <p>
     The walking tour of campus concludes near the Bryan Center. If you wish instead to park in the Bryan Center garage or the Bryan Center hourly pay lot, you should allow for a ten minute walk to the Admissions Office. Visitor parking information may be reviewed
