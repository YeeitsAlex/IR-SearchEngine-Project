      The UCR ID (R'Card) provides an interactive ID card that facilitates commerce and
                  access across campus and beyond. The high degree of integration with campus services
                  enables the ID to respond and provide solutions on-the-go in real time to a wide customer
                  base that includes faculty, staff, students, and affiliates.
     </p>
     <h4>
      Get an R'Card ($25)
     </h4>
     <p>
      Persons applying for an Râ€™Card must come to the Card Services office in person and
                  present proper identification for card issuance. A card fee may apply at the time
                  of service. Please choose the appropriate service category from the menu below for
                  more information.
     </p>
     <h4>
      Benefits
     </h4>
     <p>
      The R'Card provides access to meal plans and secured facilities on campus such as
                  residence halls and lab rooms. It is the medium for connecting users to services such
                  as library borrowing, vending, printing, and renting laptops and chargers. The R'Card
                  is a campus pass providing access to athletic games and special events. It also grants
                  the holder free bus (RTA) transportation around town. The R'Card can be programmed
                  to work as a debit card. By adding
      <a href="bearbucks/adding-funds.html">

      like grocery food, fast-food dining, text books, homecare and pharmacy items and

                        faculty member that provides the reason to issue the card early. The letter must include

         Access

        If you live in residential housing or student apartments, your R'Card's proximity
                        chip can be programmed to provide "contactless" access to buildings, doors, and gates.
                        Access is provided by the RSO of your respective living arrangement between the hours
                        of 8am and 5pm (summer hours vary). For lab or classroom access, bring your R'Card
                        to the building administrator.

       <p>
        <strong>
         Billing
        </strong>
        <br/>
        The card printing fee of $25 gets billed to the student's R'Web account (with the
                        exception of summer enrollment-only students, who pay a reduced fee of $15 at the
                        counter.)

        <strong>
         Card Replacement

        to protect account assets. Card Services can replace your R'Card anytime for a $25
                        fee, but we recommend waiting 48 - 72 hours to allow time for it to be found and returned
                        to our office. When we receive a card, we promptly notify the owner by email that
                        it is in our possession.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Tip:
        </strong>
        All door, gate, and building entry rights (see "Access") must be applied all over
                        again to the replacement card. If you work for Dining or SRC, please notify your supervisor
                        to update KRONOS with your replacement card's information.

        If your card is lost or stolen, you will be held liable for any transactions charged
                        to your account prior to taking action such as deactivating it online or calling Card

         Preferred Name:
        </strong>
        If you go by a preferred name that is different from your legal name, you have the
                        option of having it on your R'Card. You must change your name in the official University
                        records (R'Web) before you request a new ID card. The updated information usually
                        takes 48 hours to appear. Once a preferred name is chosen, it will override the legal
                        name field from being printed.

        Beware of choosing a preferred first name that is identical to your legal middle
                        name. Otherwise your R'Card will print a first and middle name that are identical.

                        identified on the ID, as well tampering or alteration on the ID, will warrant confiscation
                        and possible disciplinary action by the University.

        <strong>
         Negative Accounts
        </strong>
        <br/>
        For card balance accounts that result in a negative dollar amount (which happens when
                        a register processes a sale in offline mode) it is up to the card holder to add funds
                        to bring their account into financial compliance (i.e., a zero balance or greater).
                        Failure to do so could result in a hold being placed on your R'Card or the sum sent
                        to Main Cashiers for collection.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Proof of Identity
        </strong>
        <br/>
        This university requires proof of identity before issuing a new R'Card. Please show
                        a valid government-issue picture ID (
        <a href="docs/accepted-proofs-of-identity.pdf" target="_blank">
         see complete list
        </a>
        ). Copies or pictures of documents are not allowed.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Proper Usage and Care
        </strong>
        <br/>
        It is the cardholder's responsibility to protect and maintain the condition of their
                        card front and back to ensure durability.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Status Change
        </strong>
        <br/>
        If your cardholder status changes (e.g., from student to graduate student), you will
                        need to update your R'Card to receive library privileges.

       <p>
        If you are a high school student or attend university elsewhere but plan to enroll
                        in summer classes at UCR such as
        <a href="http://summeracademy.ucr.edu/" target="_blank">

         <strong>
          Summer Sessions
         </strong>
        </a>
        , you are eligible to receive an R'Card at a reduced rate of $15.00. This is for students
                        who are here for the short-term and who do not plan to continue UCR in the fall.
       </p>
       <p>
        Cards will be issued one week prior to the start of summer classes. Be ready to provide:
        <ul>
         <li>
          your student ID number
         </li>
         <li>
          A government-issue photo ID (high school ID or driverâ€™s permit OK for Summer Academy)
         </li>
         <li>
          Payment by credit card: VISA, MC, Discover.

         Tip:
        </strong>
        If you enroll in summer classes but wish to continue your UCR education in the fall,
                        then you will be charged the regular student new card fee of $25 and it will be billed
                        to your student account.

      <div>
       <p>
        All faculty, permanent staff, and post-docs who are on University payroll, may obtain
                        an R'Card. Your start date must have passed by 24 to 48 hours before your profile
                        appears in our ID management system. The program is NOT an originator of data but
                        receives it from authoritative sources of that data (i.e., PPS). Calling ahead with
                        your employee ID number to learn if your profile appears in our system is strongly
                        recommended: (951)827-2273.

        Helpful Tips
       </h5>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Know your employee ID number BEFORE you come. We use this number that's unique-to-you
                           to locate your profile in our ID management system. If you don't know it, ask your
                           department's hiring specialist or find it
         <a href="https://ucpath.universityofcalifornia.edu/" target="_blank">
          here

         .

          Upload your own photo
         </a>
         or have your photo taken on site before your card is printed.
        </li>
        <li>
         Present a valid government picture ID (see
         <a href="docs/accepted-proofs-of-identity.pdf" target="_blank">
          complete list

        <li>
         $25 payment due at the time of service (VISA, MC, Discover). A department may choose
                           to purchase your R'Card with a web-recharge. It is your responsibility to follow-up
                           with your department to see if this policy applies to you BEFORE you come. Once an
                           R'Card has been paid for with private funds, we cannot issue a refund.
        </li>
        <li>
         When your employment status changes to one which is no longer entitled to campus privileges,
                           your card will not grant you access to university facilities and services like the
                           bus. Please contact your manager or HR officer if your employment is expected to be
                           renewed. Once you know your restart date, access to the bus will be restored in about
                           three daysâ€™ time and your R'card will automatically start working.

       <p>
        If you are a UCR community member but are not a student or an employee, you still
                        may be eligible to obtain a UCR R'Card for campus identification purposes and/or to
                        access university services.

         Visiting Scholar
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Affiliates who are not on University Payroll must have their sponsoring department
                        fill out this form on your behalf: "
        <strong>

          Request for a UCR ID Card for Visiting and Non-Salaried Positions

        </strong>
        ." This gives the department a way of introducing the individual to Card Services.
                        A photo ID is required in order to obtain an R'Card. Driver's license or passport
                        are the preferred documents. Payment of $25.00 is due at the time of service. We accept
                        the following credit cards: VISA, MC, and Discover.

        A parent of a child enrolled in the Early Childhood Services (ECS) and who are not
                        otherwise affiliated with the University, may come in to receive a proximity access
                        card. Ask ECS staff to provide you with a "Security Proximity Access Card Authorization
                        Form"; take this form which authorizes the parent to receive the entry card, to our
                        office along with a Government-issued photo ID. Payment of $25.00 is due at the time
                        of service. We accept the following credit cards: VISA, MC, and Discover. Take the
                        entry card back to ECS to allow staff to program it with the appropriate access.
