      What do the courses cost, how do I pay, and is financial aid available?
     </a>
     <div class="content" id="panel5a">
      <ul>
       <li>
        The two courses are available at a very competitive, flat-rate tuition rate of $125 per semester hour plus a $265 institutional fee per semester. Please note that students concurrently enrolled in other programs of Columbus State University may have additional mandatory fees in addition to the institutional fee and normal tuition associated with their enrollment, and will be subject to additional tuition charges if the student’s total course load exceeds 15 hours due to scheduling these courses.
       </li>
       <li>
        Therefore, for students only taking the film certificate courses, the first course in the certificate program which is 6 semester hours of credit taken in your first semester, costs $1015 total ($750 tuition plus $265 institutional fee), due before the first day of class.
       </li>
       <li>
        The second course and final course in the certificate program carries 12 semester hours of credit, and for students only taking the film certificate courses, costs $1,765 total ($1,500 tuition plus $265 institutional fee), due before the first day of class.
       </li>
       <li>
        Please note that at this time it has not yet been determined whether students classified as out-of-state under University System of Georgia regulations would be subject to additional tuition charges.
       </li>
       <li>
        Upon registration into a course, the tuition charges will be added to your student account which you can view through our student on-line portal CougarNet. Instructions for payment options are available at
        <a href="https://bursar.columbusstate.edu/pay_online.php">
         https://bursar.columbusstate.edu/pay_online.php
