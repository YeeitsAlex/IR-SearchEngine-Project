        A key goal of Together Duke is to invest in faculty as scholars and leaders of the university’s intellectual communities. To foster collaboration around new and emerging areas of interest, Intellectual Community Planning Grants (ICPG) are available to groups of faculty.

Each panel highlights distinct clusters and indicates the cluster size, dispersion, and the most central author (measured in terms of betweenness centrality).

       <h3>
        Stickiness of Respondent-Driven Sampling Recruitment Chains
       </h3>
       <p>
        This study examines whether respondent-driven sampling (RDS) recruitment chains could get stuck in socially stratified subgroups. 
                                It uses data on female sex workers (FSW) in Liuzhou, China.  These FSW solicit clients from venues, like karaoke bars or massage parlors. 
                                To the extent that subgroups of FSW recruits clients from single, larger venues, the RDS chain could thus get stuck within these groups, leading to inefficient estimates. 
                                The results show that this is indeed the case. The figure depicts the clustering of the RDS chain by venue where the FSW solicited clients.

        Portrait of Political Party Polarization
       </h3>
       <p>
        This project explores how typical the partisanship of current American politics is and how political actors navigate divided networks. To answer this question, we measure co-voting similarity networks in the US Senate and trace individual careers over time. The figure maps this dynamic coalition network, one two-year Congress at a time. Nodes indicate structurally equivalent positions, scaled by number of Senators and shaded by their voter agreement level.

       <p>
        This article develops a framework for leveraging network information about nodes over time and over multiple types of networks in order to more effectively group them into communities. The image applies this framework to congressional voting records. It reveals a congress that has been consistently split into roughly two communities, but also shows that major events have disrupted those communities periodically, leading to realignments.

    Sparked by the confluence of a rapid rise in network techniques across the social and physical sciences, the
    <strong>
     Duke Network Analysis Center
    </strong>
    seeks to crystallize the latent talent in this area at Duke and around the triangle to build a world-premier source for cutting edge network studies. The rise of network science over the last 10 to 15 years is predicated on building scientific insight by modeling the complex   patterns of connections that link primary elements to each other. The range of such work is exceedingly broad, since the unifying network abstraction is virtually content free. Thus, social network studies add relational context to our understandings of human behavior in areas as diverse as health, culture, organizations, science or politics. Similar tools are used to great advantage in biology, physics, and ecology to name just a few.
