        The Phish Market is a list of recent emails that were reported to the KSU Office of Cybersecurity as possible phishing attempts on the University community. The Office of Cybersecurity has confirmed these messages as malicious phishing attempts. If you have received an email that you believe may contain a phishing attempt, it is possible that some of the language and links differ from similar messages posted on the Phish Market. It is not uncommon for malicious actors to create variant messages.
        <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        We update this list regularly but it is possible that you received the message before it is published to the Phish Market.  If you mistakenly provided credentials to a confirmed phishing email, please change your NetID password immediately at
        <a href="/tt/netid.kennesaw.edu/">
         https://netid.kennesaw.edu
        </a>
        .  If you receive a suspicious email not in the Phish Market, please forward it to
        <a href="mailto:abuse@kennesaw.edu">
         abuse@kennesaw.edu
        </a>

        Email is the official method of communication at Kennesaw State University. All announcements and business related correspondence are conducted through official Kennesaw State University email accounts. Any email claiming to be an employee of the university that does not originate from an “@kennesaw.edu” address should be held in suspicion, especially if it claims to be from a person of leadership. Please follow the reporting instructions above if you receive suspicious emails that meet these criteria.

           I will call you after the meeting. I need you to help me get a Steam Wallet Gift card from the store and send me pictures. I will reimburse you back when I get back to the office. I need to send it to someone and it is very important because I am still at the meeting and I need to get it sent as soon as possible. Today is my best friend's son's birthday.

          <h2>
           2018-10-05 | Phishing Message
          </h2>
          <p>
           Subject: Your password is [password]
           <br/>
           <br/>
           [password] is your password. Lets get right to point. You don't know me and you are most likely wondering why you are getting this e-mail? Not a single person has paid me to investigate about you.
          </p>
          <p>
           actually, I setup a software on the adult video clips (pornography) website and you know what, you visited this site to experience fun (you know what I mean). While you were viewing video clips, your web browser began functioning as a Remote Desktop with a key logger which gave me access to your display screen as well as cam. Right after that, my software program collected every one of your contacts from your Messenger, social networks, and e-mail . Next I made a video. First part shows the video you were watching (you've got a fine taste hahah), and second part displays the view of your web cam, yea it is you.
          </p>
          <p>
           You actually have 2 possibilities. Lets review these solutions in aspects:
          </p>
          <p>
           Very first solution is to skip this email message. In this situation, I will send your actual videotape to just about all of your contacts and also just imagine regarding the shame that you receive. Keep in mind if you happen to be in a committed relationship, just how it will affect?
          </p>
          <p>
           Other solution would be to give me $1000. Lets regard it as a donation. Subsequently, I will straight away discard your video. You will go forward your daily life like this never happened and you would never hear back again from me.
          </p>
          <p>
           You'll make the payment by Bitcoin (if you do not know this, search "how to buy bitcoin" in Google).
          </p>
          <p>
           BTC Address to send to: [BTC address]
           <br/>
           [CASE-SENSITIVE copy &amp; paste it]
          </p>
          <p>
           In case you are wondering about going to the cops, surely, this email message cannot be traced back to me. I have dealt with my steps. I am also not attempting to demand a lot, I wish to be rewarded.
          </p>
          <p>
           You have one day in order to pay. I have a specific pixel within this message, and at this moment I know that you have read through this e mail. If I don't get the BitCoins, I will certainly send your video to all of your contacts including relatives, co-workers, and so forth. Nonetheless, if I receive the payment, I will erase the video right away. If you need evidence, reply Yea! and I will certainly send your video recording to your [number] contacts. This is a nonnegotiable offer, therefore do not waste my time &amp; yours by responding to this mail.
