     Your "personal data" includes, for example, your contact information.  It may also include "special categories" of data under the GDPR. Such "special categories" include information about your racial or ethnic origin, sexual orientation, religious beliefs or other beliefs, physical or mental health, or information concerning any criminal offenses or criminal proceedings.
    </p>
    <p>
     These "special categories" of data would only be collected if (i) you have directly provided the data yourself (with your consent), for example during one-to-one conversations with our representatives or collected for event management purposes, e.g., for assessing access requirements arising from a disability, or (ii) it has been obtained from public sources.

     We may use your personal data with your consent.  In addition, Princeton has made a commitment to its students, as lifetime members of the University community, to provide services and activities for alumni, and we may use your information to fulfill that commitment.
    </p>
    <p>
     By supporting University alumni and undertaking other development activities, the University is acting in the public interest. In particular, alumni engagement and fundraising supports the University's charitable educational mission and the benefits to society that flow as a result.
    </p>

    <p>
     The European Commission provides a list of countries which, according to the Commission, have adequate data protection rules.  The list can be found here:

     If the country that we are sending your information to is not on the list, or is not a country within the EEA (which means the European Union, Liechtenstein, Norway and Iceland), then it might not have the same level of protection for personal data as the EU provides.
