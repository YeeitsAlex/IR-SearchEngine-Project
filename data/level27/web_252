             All around us in the universe, black holes are smashing into each other with tremendous force. These events are so powerful that they cause ripples in the fabric of space-time—and these ripples, called gravitational waves, travel hundreds of millions of light-years across the universe. Holz and fellow scientists at LIGO built the most sensitive machine ever constructed, detected the waves and

The answer provides clues to what Mars’ climate would have looked like eons ago when the rivers were flowing.

However, his legacy and scientific contributions will continue to inspire and influence physicists and scientists for years. UChicago physicist Daniel Holz, SM'94, PhD'98, wrote an appreciation of Hawking's legacy explaining that when he applied quantum mechanics to the classical physics of black holes, they appeared to leak particles.

             A team including UChicago cosmochemist Nicolas Dauphas performed the largest study to date of oxygen isotopes in lunar rocks, and found a small but measurable difference in the makeup of the moon and Earth. The research proposes that Earth acquired the majority of its water during the main stage of its growth—which counters a popular theory.

To make them see the light, a team of University of Chicago physicists built a trap to help photons bounce off each other. Their photon collider is the latest effort to make photons behave like other particles such as electrons—a step toward greater understanding and control of quantum systems.
