           Sick Leave Policy

          <p>
           Effective July 1, 2017, the University of Chicago implemented an updated Sick Leave Policy, HR Policy 512, which has been revised to comply with the Chicago Paid Sick Leave Ordinance. The updated Sick Leave Policy will make paid sick leave (PSL) available to some employees who have not previously had it, including non-benefits-eligible staff employees and non-benefits-eligible academic appointees, temporary employees, seasonal employees and student employees. The new policy will also expand the permissible uses of PSL for employees, including benefits-eligible employees who already have PSL.
          </p>
          <p>
           For individuals who use Workday and are newly-eligible for PSL, the “Time Off Module” is live in Workday, and a new time off worklet is now available on the Workday landing page. Benefits-eligible personnel will continue to use UChicago Time to view PSL balances and to record use of PSL.
          </p>

          <p>
           Undergraduates on a leave of absence, in general, are not eligible for employment positions that are only open to students. All students on leave of absence, regardless of the reason for their leave, are not eligible for Federal Work-Study positions.
          </p>

           If a student employee takes a special kind of leave known as extended status, they may continue working in a job that they already hold, provided that they are not in a Federal Work-Study position. Students on extended leave are not eligible to apply for a new job, but may stay in their current position for the period of the extended leave.

          <p>
           To ensure that they have sufficient time to dedicate to their academic responsibilities, graduate students may be employed by the university for a maximum of 20 hours per week during quarters of registration. During the summer, students may work for a maximum of 37.5 hours per week. A student may hold more than one job, but the cumulative number of hours worked per week cannot exceed the limits outlined above. Any exceptions to these policies must be approved by the student’s area Dean of Students. For details, please refer to the

           Sick Leave Policy
          </h3>
          <p>
           Effective July 1, 2017, the University of Chicago implemented an updated Sick Leave Policy, HR Policy 512, which has been revised to comply with the Chicago Paid Sick Leave Ordinance. The updated Sick Leave Policy will make paid sick leave (PSL) available to some employees who have not previously had it, including non-benefits-eligible staff employees and non-benefits-eligible academic appointees, temporary employees, seasonal employees and student employees. The new policy will also expand the permissible uses of PSL for employees, including benefits-eligible employees who already have PSL.
          </p>
          <p>
           For individuals who use Workday and are newly-eligible for PSL, the “Time Off Module” is live in Workday, and a new time off worklet is now available on the Workday landing page. Benefits-eligible personnel will continue to use UChicago Time to view PSL balances and to record use of PSL.
          </p>
          <p>
           To help answer any questions you may have, we have created and posted on the Workday@UChicago website a series of Quick Reference Guides, along with a set of Frequently Asked Questions.
