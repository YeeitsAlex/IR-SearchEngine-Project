            was conducting experiments that were challenging, to say the least. And he had to persevere through years of failure. He talks about that process and what sustained him through it in this interview for Freakonomics Radio's "How to Be Creative" series. "One thing that's really interesting that it's important for people to hear sometimes is that a really tough, challenging problem is worth spending a lot of time on, and that you can be learning a lot while you're trying to get there," he says. At another point in the interview, he talks about the rivalry between teams working on the same problem. "It was highly secretive between each other in general. I'd say the competition with each other was a big deal but it's nothing like the competition with the ways in which the universe is trying to give you a hard time." Link to audio.

            The prehistoric city of Cahokia, near present-day St. Louis, may have declined in part because of climate change, and we now know this because
            <b>
             doctoral anthropology student AJ White
            </b>
            took an interest in examining ancient poop there. In a newly-released study he led as a graduate student at California State University, Long Beach, he and his team found a direct link between changes in the city's population size, revealed through fecal records, and environmental data showing evidence of drought and flood. "The way of building population reconstructions usually involves archaeological data, which is separate from the data studied by climate scientists," he says. "One involves excavation and survey of archaeological remains and the other involves lake cores. We unite these two by looking at both kinds of data from the same lake cores." White says the study highlights the nuances and complications that are common to many cultures, and reveals how environmental change can contribute to social changes already taking place.

            Americans' adoption of more energy-efficient lighting has brought energy consumption down over the past eight years after steady increases over prior decades. "That's a staggering change," says
            <b>
             business professor and energy economist Lucas Davis
            </b>
            . He attributes the relatively rapid impact of the change to the short lifespan of incandescent bulbs, which last about a year, as opposed to other energy consumers -- such as refrigerators and dishwashers -- that last about ten years. "When you take out incandescent light bulbs and replace them with LEDs, the amount of electricity you consume goes down more than 80 percent," he says. "There's nothing else like that."

            "A library canceling a subscription seems like a simple, everyday business decision, so what's the big deal?" this commentator from UC Davis asks, regarding the UC system's decision to part ways with the academic publishing giant Elsevier. "The story made headlines," she says, "because it's symptomatic of the way in which the internet has failed to deliver on the promise to make knowledge easily accessible and shareable by anyone, anywhere in the world. The UC-Elsevier showdown was the latest in a succession of cracks in what is widely considered to be a failing system for sharing academic research. As the head of the research library at UC Davis, I see this development as a harbinger of a tectonic shift in how universities and their faculty share research, build reputations and preserve knowledge in the digital age. ... Our goals are ambitious and their implementation will be complex. Changing a system this intricate is akin to modernizing the FAA's air traffic control system -- a million planes are in the air at any moment and changing anything can have serious consequences elsewhere. But we have to start somewhere or the whole system is at risk, and UC has placed its bet. We join a global movement that began in Europe and is expanding around the world, and we believe we're now on the path to a better system for sharing knowledge in the 21st century."

            A group of 12 organizations has issued a statement opposing President Trump's announced plan to withhold federal funding from institutions that do not agree to support free speech. "There are and always will be individuals on campus and in society generally who wish to silence those with whom they disagree. But punitive and simplistic measures will only exacerbate the problems they may create," they wrote. The groups include the American Association of University Professors, American Federation of Teachers. Association of American Colleges &amp; Universities, Association of University Presses, and the National Coalition Against Censorship.
