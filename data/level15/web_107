The Technology Fees at the University of Tennessee have made state-of-the-art education possible for students in the College of Nursing. Now, with advancing healthcare training technologies, nurses can learn patient care skills in a safe lab environment before caring for real patients.

This way there is little chance that important structures will be missed. Maintenance is easy, there are no microscopes to service, or store and the images are available after the class so students can refer to them prior to examinations. Additionally, student feedback is consistently positive.

What will the technology fee provide for students?    Enhanced Network Access On- and Off-Campus At the time the technology fee was approved (in 1997), the network infrastructure had neither enough carrying capacity (bandwidth), nor did it include all of the campus community. Much has been done to improve the campus network, but to continue to provide and maintain a viable network into the future requires a large commitment from all areas of the university. The technology fee is an integral part of this effort. Enhanced Student Computing Labs At the time the technology fee was approved, there were six staffed, open-access computing laboratories and sixteen unstaffed laboratories. Departments and Colleges funded their special purpose labs from operating budgets or grants. Due to the technology fee, many academic labs have been upgraded, new labs have opened, and several thousand new microcomputers have been made available to students through these upgrades. Enhanced Student Support Services At the time the technology fee was approved, the OIT HelpDesk was available for thirty hours per week. Currently, it is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Statistical consulting which used to be available to students only on a fee-for-service basis, now offers up to ten hours of free consulting per student per semester with a reduced cost of $20 per hour above the ten hour limit. Workshops for technology topics as well as self-paced training courses from the Microsoft IT Academy are now available to students at no cost. Enhanced Instructional Technology The technology fee plays an important role in the use of instructional technologies on the University of Tennessee, Knoxville campus. Online@UT and LiveOnline@UT (Canvas and Zoom) are widely used to supplement face-to-face classes with online material and for offering classes totally online. Support and training for using the instructional technologies in classrooms and providing consultation and assistance to faculty to create online materials for their courses are also funded by the technology fee.   collapse   collapse title= Who controls the technology fee?   Who controls the technology fee?    The fee is levied by the Board of Trustees  all money derived there from are University or  state  funds and are under University (State) control. Administrative officers on the Knoxville campus are charged with control of all aspects of the technology fee. The Associate Vice Chancellor and CIO of the Knoxville campus, acting as the fiscal officer for the general account is responsible for the day-to-day fiscal control of the Fee and for the presentation of an annual budget that reflects the purpose of the technology fee as previously stated herein. Appropriate consultation with students and faculty will be sought. It is recognized, however, that while seeking consultation in matters pertaining to the Fee, the Associate Vice Chancellor and CIO of the Knoxville campus and other administrative officials will not delegate  control.    collapse    collapsibles ","link":"http:\/\/volweb.utk.edu\/~technologyfee\/faq\/"},{"title":"Technology Fee Usage","content":"Technology Fee Usage Technology Fee funds for Colleges and Units will be distributed based on the following usage guidelines. A yearly amount is allocated to each College Unit based on a formula.

Appropriate Student Technology Fee expenditures include  Specialized computing equipment required for course work (example  electronic manikins for College of Nursing). Departmental computing lab hardware and software. Digital peripherals such as GPS devices, still and video cameras, DVD players, and other technology equipment to be used in teaching and student   s academic work. Student Technology Fees cannot be used to fund  Departmental staff salaries. Unused Tech Fee funds may not be carried over. After verification of appropriate use, Colleges Units order hardware and software directly from vendors and are reimbursed by OIT with their allocated Technology Fee funds. Hardware and software is immediately added to the inventories of Colleges Units.
