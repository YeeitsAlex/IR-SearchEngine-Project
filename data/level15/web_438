                 SSS was first implemented on MSU’s campus in 1974, and since then, thousands of students have received significant academic tutoring, mentoring, financial guidance, personal counseling, and help with applying for graduate school. These services provide support for students outside of the classroom while also encouraging student success in the classroom.
