The shock can potentially stop an irregular heart beat (arrhythmia) and allow a normal rhythm to resume following sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). SCA occurs when the heart malfunctions and stops beating unexpectedly. If not treated within minutes, it quickly leads to death. More information can be found at The American Heart Association. UTK Information EHS suggests that department heads notify employees in their building at least annually, where the nearest AED is located. All employees should be familiar with emergency procedures, which include medical emergencies. Department heads shall have a sufficient number of employees trained in CPR AED if their building contains an AED. Trained personnel will be present when the building is open. Refresher training and record keeping are mandatory. CPR and AED courses are available locally through the American Red Cross, the American Heart Association or other programs recognized by the Tennessee Emergency Medical Services Board.

Each institution should commit to providing a campus environment that supports the health and safety practices of its community (faculty, students, staff, and visitors) and empowers the community to be responsible for the safety of others. A safe campus environment is a right of employment for all categories of employees. A safe campus learning environment is a right of all involved in education and research. 2. Good science is safe science. Safety is a critical component of scholarly excellence and responsible conduct of research.   half   half  3. Safety training and safety education are essential elements of research and education. They instill a culture of safety in the next generation of researchers and future faculty, and they are important for our students    career development and employability. 4. An improved culture of safety is necessary to truly reduce risk throughout the academic enterprise. 5.

All reported concerns will be addressed, investigated and corrective measures taken when necessary. Employees are free from retaliatory or disciplinary actions for reporting safety concerns. No employee shall be discharged or discriminated against because such employee has filed any complaint or instituted or caused to be instituted any proceedings or inspections under, or relating, to this program. For the purposes of this document the phrase    safety hazard    shall also include health hazard and environmental hazard. In addition, near misses or non-injury accidents are covered by the standard. New employees shall be informed of the process of reporting hazards during orientation. Procedures All safety hazards should be reported to the employee   s immediate supervisor as soon as possible. Work within the department to resolve the issue, if possible. Supervisors are encouraged to contact Environmental Health and Safety if there is no clear solution or if additional guidance is needed. If the matter cannot be adequately addressed, the individual may contact Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) or Risk Management. Safety concerns may be reported by telephone, fax, e-mail, written letter or in person to any EHS staff member (can complete the Service Request form found in Appendix A), or by completing the Incident Report form provided by Risk Management (see Appendix B). Safety, occupational health hazards or environmental concerns may be e-mailed to  safety@utk.edu. Concerns may be reported confidentially and should be so indicated when reporting. Every effort shall be made to protect the identity of the person making the complaint. EHS shall log reported workplace hazard complaints. Quarterly reports of reported safety hazards shall be included on the EHS quarterly metric. EHS shall address the concern in a timely manner and take appropriate action. A record of communiques and associated information shall be maintained in the building file by EHS for at least three years. Feedback and updates shall be submitted to the individual filing the complaint if a request it made. All near misses (also known as a close call or non-injury accident) should be reported in a manner similar to other hazards.  see Reporting Hazards and Near Misses in the Safety Manual ","link":"https:\/\/ehs.utk.edu\/index.php\/reporting-hazardous-conditions\/"},{"title":"About the Safety Manual","content":"About the Safety Manual  collapsibles   collapse title= The Basics  active= true   The Safety Manual is a collection of policies, procedures, plans, and guides.   These documents are the primary drivers of health, safety, and environmental compliance at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.   These elements are created under the authority of the Safety Officer of the UTK campus and are generated through the collaboration of EHS personnel, campus administration, and other subject matter experts.   collapse   collapse title= Important Definitions   The following is a very short glossary that may be helpful in understanding the Safety Manual.   These definitions are meant to be simplified and informative.   Regulations may have more detailed definitions. Hierarchy of Safety Requirements Laws can be called laws, acts, statutes etc.   They are passed by legislative bodies such as Congress, state legislatures, or municipal governments. Laws are usually responsible for authorizing a regulatory body or agency to create and promulgate (put forth) regulations. Examples  The Occupational Safety & Health Act authorized the creation of the Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) which creates safety regulations for the workplace.   The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Clean Air Act, all contribute to the authority of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Regulations are rules created by regulatory agencies such as OSHA, the EPA, or the Department of Transportation (DOT). Regulations vary significantly.   Some are prescriptive and will tell you exactly what you can and cannot do  some are performance-based where a safe outcome is required, and your organization must do what is appropriate to ensure that outcome occurs (this is usually through the creation of plans and procedures specific to your organization). Some regulations will point to a third party consensus standard that must be followed as though it were a legally binding regulation. Policies statements of expected standard practice within an organization. They can be in the form of a policies that go  above and beyond  regulatory requirements. UTK community members follow policies created at both the state level  (system) and the campus level (UTK). Environmental Health & Safety campus policies (in this manual) should be cross referenced to UTK s Policy Central.   System Policy website  policytech (As of late 2017 this is the new location for system-wide policies) Campus Policy website http   policycentral.utk.edu  Procedures & Plans Some regulations require the creation of a procedure or plan to achieve a desired safe outcome or performance.   Some EHS-UTK safety Procedures and Plans will tell members of the UTK community exactly what they should do  others will provide a template for creating a site specific plan. Given the diverse nature of the UTK community, many require additional information from your unit. Examples The Chemical Hygiene Plan (Lab Safety) Lock-Out Tag-Out Procedures for controlling hazardous energy Guides Can be a restatement of the regulations in an easier to digest format or in a format relevant to UTK work spaces. They can also serve as guides to best practice for known types of hazards. Guides are designed for ease of use, but may not provide detail for all situations. Some guides are highly detailed and some are short communications, posters, and flyers. Common terms Best Practices Procedures that are accepted or prescribed as being correct or most effective.   They can be derived from professional or collective knowledge.   Many consensus standards are considered to be  best practices  although they may not be required by regulation. Can A permissive statement.   A  can  statement implies that whatever follows is a way to achieve the goal, but may not be the only way.   Some safety documents offer potential solutions with  can  statements.   Realize that other means may be permissible. Shall (must) Something that must be done.   Unless specified, there may not be an alternative method or exemption to a  Shall  statement.   Shall statements must be followed and are legally binding. Should Should statements imply that the regulation does not explicitly require the action.   If a should statement exists, then it is acknowledged that there is a best practice for an activity. Ignoring best practice is not advised. Types of Agencies and Standards Regulatory Agencies Agencies empowered by law to create and promulgate (put forth) regulations that are legally binding. Consensus Standards Standards created by non-regulatory agencies that define best practices for a particular industry.   These non-regulatory agencies are made up of business & industrial leaders, government representatives, union representatives, scientists and engineers, as well as other interested parties to create consensus. Each organization may promulgate numerous standards. It is important to note that some regulations may  point  to a consensus standard and require it by law.   This is known as  incorporation  of a standard  by reference . Examples of organizations include  National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) American National Standards Institute (ANSI) National Institute for Occupational Safety & Health (NIOSH) Examples of consensus standards  NFPA 101 - Life Safety Code NFPA 45 - Fire Protection for Laboratories Using Chemicals ANSI Z87.1 - Standard for Eye Protection Prescriptive Standards Standards that state exactly what must be done.   For example, OSHA General Industry standards requires fall protection above 4 feet of working height  6 feet for Construction. Performance Standards Standard that are interested in outcome. Explicit procedures may not be given, but non-mandatory templates and guides are often provided as appendices to the standards.   Examples  The Lab Standard requires the creation of a Chemical Hygiene Plan for the safe use of laboratory chemicals.   This plan is in place of the more explicit requirements for General Industry use of chemicals in the workplace (known as Hazard Communication).   collapse   collapse title= How to use the Safety Manual   The Safety Manual has existed as a set of approximately ninety titles.

It is time to update chemical inventories at UT. To accomplish this, each location that uses or stores hazardous materials must submit an updated chemical inventory every March. if you have direct access to the inventory system (2017 or earlier) you may access it here. For more detailed information see the Safety Manual Chemical Inventory Procedure Why do we do this? Reporting Requirements Maintaining up-to-date chemical inventories is required for regulatory compliance and emergency response. Some regulations require that organizations report to them quantities of various hazardous chemicals. Examples include the EPA, TDEC, DHS and the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-know Act (EPCRA). Effective Emergency Response Environmental Health and Safety as well as other allied groups (i.e. Biosafety, Radiations Safety, UTIA Safety Office) participate in a 24-hour on-call system. During an emergency response accessing the chemical inventory database may be helpful in determining risk whether it be a fire or accidental release. Not just for labs The Chemical inventory is not just for labs. Any location that stores hazardous chemicals is included. Examples of non-lab areas are those where materials such as cleaning products or maintenance supplies (such as lubricants, cleaning agents, paints, and industrial solvents) are stored. Instructions  First, if you are the assigned responsible party for your space and you have submitted an inventory in the past, you should have received a notification email on or around January 17, 2017. If you have not received an email or know that you have never submitted an inventory for your space then you should contact your campus representative (below) to request a template and instructions. If there are no substantial changes from your last inventory, email your campus contact to let them know the content has not changed but that you did evaluate it. You must let them know if there was  no change  in order to fulfill the chemical inventory requirement. If you have changes  Please review the attached excel file with your inventory data, make appropriate updates, and then email the updated file to your campus EHS contact listed below  The two attached files you should receive via email. Your current inventory. This file is provided to assist you, however if you have a more up-to-date inventory you are welcome to use it, however we must receive an Excel or CSV file in the same format EHS has provided. Template with detailed instructions on inventory data requirements and formatting which can answer many questions. Download the guidelines document ChemInvGuide2016 If this is your first inventory or you need a blank template it may be downloaded here  Chemical Inventory Template Inspection and Disposal  This is also an opportunity to inspect your chemicals and take action on any that are abandoned or unwanted, have faded missing illegible labels (re-label these if you plan to keep them), and or are deteriorating  i.e. chemicals with bulging lids, cracked containers, past expiration date, or have lost purity and are no longer usable and should be turned in to EHS for disposal. Deleting inventoried chemicals that you no longer possess  Please remember to also delete entries for chemicals that are no longer in your possession. Relocating your lab? For labs that are in the process of relocating, please complete the inventory after the move, so that the information going into the system is accurate for the upcoming year. If the move will not be finished in time to complete the inventory by the March 2nd deadline, contact EHS for an extension. Also if you are moving please contact EHS. We may be able to assist with lab clean outs of chemicals or give advice on best practices to make the move safer. Important Items to include  Compressed gas cylinders (including lecture bottles). Knowing which labs have compressed gas cylinders is very important to the Fire Dept. for emergency response.

Please visit the warehousing decontamination certification page for more details.   http   warehousing.utk.edu decontamination-forms  Considerations for surplus equipment management We ask you to bear in mind that the surplus warehouse workers have no special knowledge about laboratory practices and potential contaminants. When they receive something from a lab that looks dirty, they must assume a hazardous contaminant. These items going to surplus, if not purchased by another department on campus, are auctioned off to the general public, so items must be cleaned out and decontaminated by lab personnel so that no one is unintentionally harmed. Before Decontamination Know or find out the history of the piece of equipment What was it used for? What might the equipment be contaminated with? Wear appropriate PPE (disposable nitrile gloves, safety glasses or goggles, lab coat) during decontamination and spill clean-up. All containers (samples, etc.) must be removed before decontamination of equipment begins. Clean up all spills in or on the equipment prior to decontaminating (spill clean-up materials may need to be disposed of as hazardous waste or biohazardous waste, or radiological waste as appropriate. Contact the appropriate safety office for assistance with this. Determine if the design, materials, or construction of the equipment will have an effect on the decontamination process. Crevices, joints and pores constitute barriers to the penetration of liquid disinfectants and prolonged contact time may be required to accomplish decontamination, depending on the intricacy of the design and the amount of soil present.

The University of Tennessee, Institute of Agriculture (UTIA) is considered a separate entity with regard to this policy. This Policy applies to  All University of Tennessee faculty, staff, visiting scholars using UT property, as well as students who conduct activities or oversee operations of a laboratory as that term is defined in this Policy The use by these individuals of potentially hazardous operations, materials, or energy. This policy applies to all laboratories and laboratory workers at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.   This includes the UTK main campus, research at JIAM, or any other campus or off-campus laboratory related activity that would fall under UTK oversight. The University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture (UTIA) is considered a separate entity with regard to this policy While every research and teaching laboratory may have differing specific requirements for what is needed to ensure a healthy and safe working and learning environment, the University acknowledges that there are some requirements common to all.   The health and safety requirements for all laboratories must include these general requirements  Adequate training and supervision of persons working in laboratory spaces RESERVED Provision of personal protective equipment (PPE), as applicable, to those conducting activities in laboratories Established requirements for procuring, using, transporting and disposing of potentially hazardous materials and physical hazards, as applicable Established requirements for responding to incidents and emergencies Clearly assigned roles and responsibilities Specific requirements depend on the materials, equipment and environmental factors unique to each laboratory.   The Lab-Specific Chemical Hygiene Plan is the repository of the lab specific requirements and must be established and maintained by the Principal Investigator of the Lab or the lab manager supervisor. All University employees are responsible for adhering to applicable safety policies, procedures, laws, and rules, for promoting the safety of co-workers and students and for protecting the local environment.   Employees must report to their supervisors or other institutional reporting authorities and correct, if possible, all safety and environmental concerns.   Principal Investigators, Supervisors, Department Heads and Deans have additional responsibilities as articulated below in the roles and responsibilities section. Failure to follow applicable safety requirements for the specific laboratory spaces in which a University employee works, or for which he or she has supervisory responsibility, may result in a corrective action plan with the potential to escalate to the closure of the laboratory or banning from laboratory spaces and or processes.

As part of a comprehensive safety program the University will conduct routine hazard surveillance inspections. It is the responsibility of every employee to ensure their work area is free is hazards and unsafe conditions. Scope and Applicability Scope  This plan only applies to safety inspections (hazard surveillance) conducted by Environmental Health and Safety (EHS).   It is noted that other departments also conduct periodic safety inspections.     The scope of this procedure addresses facilities that fall under the purview of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. Note that laboratory safety inspections may be handled slightly different and addressed in a separate policy (LS-2). Applicability  This plan only applies to safety inspections (hazard surveillance) conducted by Environmental Health and Safety (EHS).   It is noted that other departments also conduct periodic safety inspections.   The safety inspections ensure compliance with federal, state and local safety requirements.   These requirements include, but are not limited to OSHA, TOSHA and the EPA. Definitions and Abbreviations EHS - Environmental Health and Safety OSHA - Occupational Health and Safety Administration TOSHA - Tennessee Occupational Health and Safety Administration EPA - Environmental Protection Agency NFPA - National Fire Prevention Association Procedure EHS shall  Conduct safety inspections of all buildings on the UTK campus annually. Coordinate and prioritize correction of hazards with Facilities Services or responsible department. Train designated inspectors in procedures. Conduct or coordinate follow-up inspections in ensure corrective actions have been accomplished. Responsible Units shall  Ensure that all citations issued under their responsibility are addressed within 45 days of receiving the inspection. Assist EHS personnel during inspections. Procedure Details EHS will inspect all structures periodically. Exterior walking surfaces immediately adjacent to the building shall be inspected as part of the annual inspection. Off-site facilities shall be identified and inspected periodically. Annual inspections are generally comprehensive in nature and seek to identify all hazards and deficiencies observed at the time of inspection. These reviews shall look at the facilities, equipment (fixed and portable) and practices (to the extent feasible). Exterior walking surfaces that are remote from a building, such as a parking lot or sidewalk shall be inspected every three years. Those findings will be presented in a separate report. Results are placed in tabular form in either an Excel or Word format and submitted to the appropriate individual or department via e-mail for correction. All items should be corrected as soon as possible given available resources, logistics and the difficulty of repair. Department are expected to respond to the inspection report within 45 days of receipt indicating what actions have been, or will be, taken to address the finding. Note that a short response deadline applies to laboratory inspections. Photographs may be taken as part of the inspection process and attached to the appropriate item on the report. Equipment that is found to be dangerous (unsafe for use) shall be tagged out of service by EHS. The term    dangerous    can be subjective and involve a degree of professional judgment. Focus inspections (limited in scope and nature) occur periodically in respect to requests or new information. Management of these inspections shall be similar to this procedure, but may also be handled on a case-by-case basis. Beginning in 2015, EHS shall conduct analysis of inspection reports to determine trends and summarize findings. Safety violations that have been noted on three or more consecutive reports shall be placed in red font. Items that are considered capital projects shall likewise be placed in red, italicized font. After these items have been posted three times, Capital projects will be added to a spreadsheet found on the EHS SharePoint web-site, where upon the findings will be reported to UT administration annually. Recordkeeping EHS shall keep a record of the inspection reports for at least 10 years. The records are currently maintained on the EHS department I drive, organized by year of inspection and building.

One component of a comprehensive injury prevention program is incident accident investigation. Non-injury accidents (also known as near misses) shall be reported using the incident report form, which is available from the Workers Compensation Office. Applicability  This procedure shall apply to students, visitors, staff and faculty at the University of Tennessee on university property. It shall also apply to students, visitors, staff and faculty engaged in off-site, University-sponsored activities. Procedures Employees are encouraged to report on-the-job accidents as soon as possible to their immediate supervisor. This reporting should occur whether or not medical treatment is necessary. When an accident occurs, the employee   s supervisor or lead employee should investigate the accident. The area where the accident occurred should be viewed and statements should be obtained from any witnesses. Questions regarding the accident incident report should be direct to the Risk Management Office.   A Supervisors Report of Employee Accident form is available at      http   riskmanagement.tennessee.edu Environmental Health and Safety shall review all Workers Comp claims and shall investigate those where a hazard is present, where appropriate safety procedures were not followed or where personal protective equipment was not used or was defective. The Risk Management Office may forward other claims (property loss, visitor accidents) and incident reports to campus Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) for review and investigation. If the incident resulted in, or had the potential to result in, a serious injury or property loss it should be reported to EHS. EHS will conduct a more detailed investigation and can also be contacted to investigate an accident if the supervisor   has reason to suspect that there may be fraud involved if there is a safety hazard present that can   t be removed or repaired promptly if litigation is likely if a serious process failure exists that is likely to result in additional accidents or losses If any action is necessary resulting from the investigation conducted by EHS, the findings will be forward to the appropriate supervisor and or department head. EHS will track the status of any recommendations from the investigation. Summary data of accidents shall be submitted periodically to the Safety Committee. EHS shall investigate chemical spills releases and fires. Summary data of these events plus the total number of OSHA reportable accidents shall be entered into the EHS quarterly metric report that is submitted to the Vice Chancellor for Finance and Administration.   In addition the end-of-year summary report of these metrics shall go to the Safety Committee. The campus director of EHS shall review motor vehicles accident reports periodically and take action where necessary. In addition, this individual shall review the monthly OSHA 300 log and conduct investigations as needed. Recordkeeping The Risk Management Office shall maintain all records of accidents, claims and incidents for at least five years.   EHS shall maintain records associated with investigations for at least five years. Documentation and records of accidents and losses that are expected to result in litigation or take years to settle shall be kept more than five years. Training and Information Incoming employees shall be informed of the process to report accidents and near misses during new employee orientation.   Supervisors shall be informed of the accident reporting process during the Supervisor   s Safety class, which is sponsored by Employee and Organizational Development. Current employees shall be reminded of the accident and near miss reporting process annually via Tennessee Today.

EHS is available to assist departments identify training needs, review content and present programs. Appendix A contains a list of required training programs and refresher frequency. Note that safety training may be necessary when  New tasks are assigned (which include new or different hazards) An employee transfers to a different job New hazards are recognized. New regulations or standards are developed that have a training component The employee demonstrates a lack of understanding of applicable safety policies, procedures, guidance documents or alike New Employee Orientation New employees shall receive appropriate safety training, which is generally required before the individual undertakes a task covered the by that standard. Departments are encouraged to address safety subjects (tasks, chemicals, process, equipment, procedures, hazards, etc.) specific to their employees before the employee starts work. Note that in many cases safety regulations require training specific to the hazard. Sources of Training Training can be provided by any one of the following  Department Traditional classroom from EHS upon request Skillsoft Self-study format available from EHS online DVD from EHS Self-study modules (paper copy) available from EHS Outside vendors Note that EHS is available to review the content of training to determine if it meets regulatory requirements. Refresher Training Most safety training requires an annual refresher.   In programs where there is no specified frequency for retraining it is suggested that a three-year interval be observed. Note that refresher training may be necessary when the following occurs  The employee demonstrates a lack of knowledge in the subject Equipment, processes or procedures related to this subject change New or revised regulations are promulgated Verification of Employee Knowledge It is imperative that the person receiving the training fully understands the information presented relative to his or her activities.   Departments shall make provisions for employees who have limited reading skills or where English is not the employee   s primary language. One suggested approach to document that the employee understands the training is by a quiz or test.   These tools also offer an opportunity to reinforce key points of the subject.   A minimum score of 70% is deemed acceptable to pass a safety quiz or test. Specificity of Training Training provided by EHS to departments on campus is by its nature somewhat general.

Consult Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations or Environmental Health and Safety for additional information regarding hazardous waste. Applicability     This shall apply to all students, staff and faculty on the Knoxville campus of the University of Tennessee. Scope     This standard applies to all hazardous waste as defined below. Abbreviations DOT-Department of Transportation EHS-Environmental Health and Safety HAZWOPER-Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response Standard IATA- International Air Transportation Agency RCRA-Resource Conservation and Recovery Act SAA-Satellite Accumulation Area TDEC-Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation Definitions Hazardous Waste     The EPA defines hazardous waste as a material that no longer has an intended value with properties that make it dangerous or potentially harmful to human health or the environment. Hazardous wastes can exist as liquids, solids, contained gases, or sludges. They can be the by-products of manufacturing processes or simply discarded commercial products, like cleaning fluids or pesticides. In regulatory terms, a RCRA hazardous waste is either a listed waste that appears on one of the four hazardous wastes lists (F-list, K-list, P-list, or U-list), and or exhibits at least one of four characteristics   ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity, or toxicity. Hazardous waste is regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Subtitle C, which is enforced by the EPA on a federal level, and by TDEC on a state level. Roles and Responsibilities The management of hazardous chemical waste at the University consists of the coordination and direction of the waste generated in hundreds of laboratories and other campus facilities. To manage this large volume effectively, it is necessary to use the services and technical expertise of Environmental Health and Safety (EHS), faculty, and staff members. This section briefly describes the function of each group and its role in the hazardous chemical waste management program. University Administration The Chancellor of the University is responsible for the administration of policy pertaining to institutional safety and health-related matters. The chancellor oversees the administration of safety policies through the chain of authority within the institution, delegating to deans, department heads, principle investigators and supervisors the responsibility for ensuring safe work practices of those under their supervision and adherence to established policy and guidelines. EHS EHS is responsible for surveillance of all laboratory activities involving the use of toxic agents and all additional chemical and biological problem areas within the confines of the University. A list of staff members from EHS is available as Appendix A. Specific duties of the department include  Monitor the implementation of the safety and health policies of the University. Design and improve disposal procedures for chemical waste materials. Prepare, submit, and maintain records, reports and manifests as required by government regulations. Prepare applications for state and federal permits to generate and properly dispose of hazardous chemical waste. Schedule and co-ordinate the activities of the hazardous waste contractors on campus. Ensure the university   s compliance with all applicable federal (EPA) and state (TDEC) environmental regulations concerning hazardous waste. Ensure the university is making an effort to minimize the amounts of hazardous waste generated on campus. Be a liaison representing the university during EPA and TDEC regulatory inspections. Principal Investigator, Classroom Instructor or Supervisor The principal investigator, classroom instructor, or supervisor has the direct responsibility for assuring that the policy and guidelines established herein are followed by all personnel, including other researchers under their jurisdiction. Laboratory Workers, Employees, Students, and Other Individuals The success of the hazardous chemical waste management program at the University is dependent on the conscientious efforts of the individual laboratory worker and staff employee. Because the laboratory workers frequently handle hazardous chemicals, it is essential that they follow the advice, policies, and procedures pertaining to hazardous materials handling. The individual staff members are expected to  Manage and dispose of all chemical waste in accordance with established procedures set forth in this disposal policy. Maintain the identity of all chemicals with which they work. Package and label surplus and waste chemicals in accordance with established procedures set forth in this disposal policy. Seek the advice, when necessary, of EHS concerning the proper handling and disposal of hazardous chemicals. Ensure they are properly trained on hazardous waste management, and that this documented training is refreshed on an annual basis. Procedures Container Management  All containers must be leak-proof and chemically compatible with their contents. Lids should fit properly so that the container is leak proof. When selecting a waste container, pay attention to the original container material to ensure waste added to the container is not incompatible with residues of the original material. Make sure empty containers once used to hold product are clean and does not contain any remaining product residue. Bags may be used only for dry solids. Needles (capped or uncapped), pipettes, broken glass or other sharp-edged materials that are chemically contaminated are not acceptable in bags. All  sharps  should be placed in puncture-resistant containers. Containers which show signs of contamination on their exterior are not acceptable regardless of their contents. EHS must take every step available to protect its staff from potential chemical hazards. Containers and bags marked with biohazard or radioactive warnings are not acceptable for chemical waste disposal. If a waste has biological and  or radiological and chemical hazards, please contact EHS for guidance before packaging. Minimize void space in containers by assuring that collection containers should be filled to capacity (with a little head room for expansion) before requesting disposal or combining two containers of identical material into one. When adding hazardous waste to a container, only the constituents that are specifically listed on the waste label should be added and care must be taken not to mix incompatibles. All containers must be closed with a tight-fitting lid, unless waste is being added or removed from the container. It is illegal to store waste in an open container. Labeling Requirements  In order to comply with state and federal regulations and University policy, the following information must appear on each container of hazardous waste.  Hazardous Waste   State and federal regulations require that each container must be clearly marked with the words,  Hazardous Waste . EHS requires that all hazardous waste must be labeled with a UTK hazardous waste label. Labels can be obtained from EHS. Generator s Name  The individual who is responsible for the area or process from which the waste originated and contact information (including name, phone # and room #) for the best person to contact if further information about the material is needed. Chemical Constituents  Write all constituents, whether hazardous or non-hazardous, on the waste label. Formulas, trade names, abbreviations, and general names and nomenclature are not acceptable. The proper chemical name must be written out in its entirety. Provide percentage of constituents, if known. Estimates are acceptable. Do not add an accumulation start date  this will be completed by EHS. The date will be added when the waste is brought to EHS for disposal. Below is an example of a properly completed hazardous waste label  Storage Requirements  Any container used for disposal and storage of waste must be marked with the information specified in the Labeling section immediately upon placing the first drop of waste into the container. Whenever possible, store flammable waste liquids and waste corrosive liquids in cabinets designed for these materials. Maximum amount that can accumulate in the lab is 55 gallons of hazardous waste or 1 kilogram of acutely toxic waste (Appendix B). If you accumulate more than the maximum amount, the waste needs to be removed from your lab no later than 3 days after these maximum amounts are reached. All waste must be stored in secondary containment (i.e. cabinets and trays), and should be segregated according to hazard class (i.e. flammables, toxics, etc.). The EHS web-site has a partial list of common incompatible chemicals. All hazardous waste should be stored in a Satellite Accumulation Area (SAA) which should be clearly marked with a sign (signs can be obtained from EHS). Disposal  Hazardous waste should be brought to the following locations, or contact EHS at 974-5084 to coordinate a pickup. Waste should never be left unattended outside the waste room. It must be accepted by an EHS representative. Note that times are subject to change. Please visit the EHS website, https   ehs.utk.edu  for details and the latest schedule. Walters Waste room (Room M209)  Hours  The first and third Wednesday of every month, 12 45-1 45 p.m. SERF (Science & Engineering Research Facility) Waste room (at loading dock)  Hours  Every Wednesday, 2 00-3 00 p.m. Dabney Buehler Approximately monthly there is a direct pickup by the UTK waste contractor at the loading dock. This is announced via email (usually to the Chemistry Listserv). JIAM Every other Tuesday 1 30-2 30p Strong Hall Every other Thursday 1 30-2 30p Additional Waste Rooms (Mossman) will be added in 2018 Dates and times to be determined General Requirements  Hazardous waste should never be disposed of down the sanitary sewer, the storm sewer, placed in the regular trash, by evaporation (a container without a lid implies evaporation for volatile substances), mixing with a biohazard, or mixing with a non-hazardous substance (i.e. dilution). The following items are not classified as hazardous waste and are not included in this policy  sewage  regular trash  universal waste (fluorescent bulbs, batteries)  radioactive and biohazard. The burden of hazardous waste determination lies with the waste generator. If unsure whether a waste is hazardous, reviewing the material safety data sheet (MSDS or SDS) or original container labels are good starting points. Unlabeled containers present a number of problems. When in doubt, assume the waste is hazardous and manage as a hazardous waste. EHS should be consulted with any questions concerning hazardous waste determinations. Every effort must be made to minimize and reduce the volumes of hazardous waste generated on campus. Please refer to UTK   s Hazardous Waste Minimization Plan for ideas on waste reduction. Recordkeeping EHS shall serve as the primary location for records related to hazardous waste. Records shall be maintained on the following Hazardous waste manifests Annual reports Land disposal restrictions Waste stream profiles Waste determinations Disposal certificates Waste Minimization Plan Emergency Contingency Plan Training DOT Hazardous Material Shipping IATA Hazardous Materials Shipping OSHA Hazardous Waste Operations Communiqu  s from and to  Regulatory agencies Hazardous waste vendors Generators of hazardous waste University administration Most of these records must be maintained for three years to meet regulatory requirements.   However to be prudent these records will be kept indefinitely. Training records shall be maintained by the individual department to whom the employee or student reports. Training records for employees may also be kept in IRIS. Training and Information Requirements The director of EHS shall ensure that select staff members in the department are adequately trained in the following subjects  Hazardous substances DOT shipping requirements Hazardous waste management  RCRA regulations Personal protective equipment OSHA HAZWOPER Procedure for submitting the annual report to the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation Department heads, having individuals (staff, faculty and students) under their control who generate hazardous waste, are required under federal and state law to ensure these individuals have been trained and that training must be documented. Training is available from EHS in the form of traditional classroom, or online formats. Training must be completed annually for individuals who generate and manage hazardous waste. For training information, refer to the EHS website or 974-5084.

Substances that are considered physical hazards (flammable substances, explosives, shock sensitive, etc.) are included in the definition of a hazardous substance.   The OSHA Hazard Communication Standard, 29 CFR 1910.1200 and the OSHA Chemical Hygiene Plan 29 CFR 1910.1450 are the two main standards that define a hazardous substance The following substances should be included in the chemical inventory in the workplace Compressed gas cylinders and lecture bottles Flammables liquids or solids Corrosive liquids or solids Organic peroxides Oxidizing material Toxic or poisonous materials Environmental toxins Reactive solids or liquids (pyrophorics, air water reactives, etc.) Explosive materials Any other hazardous substance not excluded by the following section The following substances are excluded from the chemical inventory in the workplace Consumer chemicals used in a manner that is similar to domestic-type application (e.g. Household bleach solution used to sanitize surfaces and equipment, Household baking soda used for cleaning and odor control.) Prescription and over-the-counter medication taken by personnel Hazardous waste Consumer products (e.g. cigarette lighters) in the workplace that contain hazardous materials and are for personal use Substances containing less than 1% of hazardous material (less than 0.1% carcinogens ) Biohazards Radioisotopes Hazardous materials (gasoline, oil, anti-freeze, etc.) found in University- owned or private vehicles and considered integral to the vehicle   s operation Hazardous materials that are part of the building (e.g. lead paint) or contained in an article (e.g. furniture) Non-hazardous substances (e.g. agarose, HPLC-grade water, sand, Glass beads). Chemical User     Any department or group of university employees that handle hazardous substances on university property, or that work offsite engaged in university-sponsored activities. Chemical Users can manage chemical inventories functionally either for a single lab or for multiple areas. Roles and Responsibilities Chemical users shall  Update their inventory list at least annually (on-line or submitted electronically to EHS) by March 1 each year, or the first Monday in March (whichever comes first). Ensure that every individual working with hazardous substances has access to the chemical inventory for that area in either an electronic or hard copy. Department heads who have chemical users under their control shall  Designate an individual to be responsible for the chemical inventory for the Ensure new chemical users who purchase or bring hazardous substances to the university complete a chemical inventory within 30 days of the substance arrival on campus. Ensure their employees submit the chemical inventory on an annual basis. EHS shall  Provide a format for developing a chemical inventory. Review the chemical inventory, take action as necessary, and submit inventory data to Facilities Services for inclusion in the chemical inventory database Review and update the chemical inventory procedure as necessary. Serve as a technical resource for questions and comments regarding the chemical inventory. Disseminate information regarding the procedure. Maintain the security of the information. Provide ready access to the inventory during an emergency (accidental release). Submit necessary reports to regulatory agencies. Develop and review reports (e.g. CFATS) Facilities Services shall  Send electronic copy of chemical inventory to chemical user. Provide a computer platform to manage chemical inventory data. Process requests to update inventory data. Develop custom reports of inventory data if requested. Maintain the security of the information. Procedures Chemical users must submit a current chemical inventory between January 15 and March 1 each year. Departments that do not respond by March 1 will be reminded of the need to complete their inventory. Facilities Services shall send an electronic copy of the current inventory to the chemical user between January 15 and March 1. In addition, guidelines for completion of the inventory shall be included.   Chemical users who no longer possess hazardous substances should indicate such. As a minimum the following information must be included in the chemical inventory  Chemical name and CAS# For brand name products, list the product name or common description (e.g.WD-40) Only hazardous components in a mixture need to be listed Please spell out chemical names rather than using abbreviations or formulas Amount and units for each container (volume or mass in English or metric units) Number of Containers     indicate the number of containers if more than one Location - building and room number Contact person     person to whom the space is assigned, a secondary contact may also be indicated Other information that may be helpful includes the concentration (percent by volume). If a substance belonging to a department or research group is moved periodically between several rooms or labs, it will be acceptable to list the location within a range of rooms. Example room 423-429 or 423, 465, 466. The quantity of substance should be expressed in units that are typical of that physical state. Examples  Liquid     (gallons, quart, liters, milliliters) Solid     (pounds, kilograms, milligrams) Gas     (cubic feet) For simplicity it is permissible to enter the listed amount of hazardous chemical on the container at the time it was purchased as opposed to the actual volume or mass. The volume of compressed gases may be listed as the number of cubic feet of gas that the cylinder originally held when filled. Consult the chemical   s MSDS SDS to determine if a substance is hazardous or contains hazardous components. If the MSDS SDS does not provide clear information, contact EHS. Contact EHS regarding chemicals that are a trade secret. In general, EHS will seek to include the hazard class (e.g. flammable liquid), but not the exact substance where confidentiality must be preserved. The chemical inventory is used to develop the EPCRA report, which is prepared by EHS. This report is submitted to the appropriate agencies before March 1st each year. Recordkeeping Starting in 2008 the University   s central archived chemical inventories shall be kept for at least 30 years.   These records may be kept in electronic or hard copy form. The EPCRA Report shall be kept at least three years. Material Safety Data Sheets   Safety Data Sheets must be kept indefinitely.

Consult title 40 Code of Federal Regulations, Facilities Services Department, or Environmental Health and Safety for additional information regarding universal waste. Scope and Applicability This standard applies to all universal waste as defined below. This shall apply to all students, staff and faculty on the Knoxville campus of the University of Tennessee. Abbreviations and Definitions Abbreviations DOT     Department of Transportation EHS     Environmental Health and Safety PCB     Polychlorinated Biphenyls TSCA     Toxic Substances Control Act Definitions Universal waste- Universal waste means any of the following hazardous wastes that are managed under the universal waste requirements of 40 CFR Part 273, and includes  Batteries Pesticides Mercury-containing equipment Fluorescent lamps Roles and Responsibilities The management of universal waste at the University of Tennessee is managed by Facilities Services and consists of the coordination and direction of the waste generated in numerous campus facilities. This section briefly describes the function of each group and its role in the universal waste management program. Recycling Coordinator Ensure universal waste is being managed, stored, and disposed of according to all applicable federal, state and local regulations. Develop and provide training to departments and individuals who generate and manage universal waste. Coordinate universal waste pickups with a universal waste disposal contractor. Select and manage universal waste disposal contractor. Maintain universal waste disposal records. EHS Ensure the Universal waste policy is implemented on campus and revise the policy periodically. Provide guidance and assistance to Facilities Services in ensuring Universal waste is being managed properly. Clean up spills involving universal waste (such as leaking batteries, PCB ballasts) and dispose of the cleanup material. Provide training assistance for departments or individuals seeking universal waste training. Supervisors Supervisors have the direct responsibility for assuring that the policy and guidelines established herein are followed by all personnel under their jurisdiction. Maintenance Employees (Facilities Services) Package, label, store, dispose, and otherwise manage Universal waste in accordance with established procedures set forth in this disposal guide. Seek the advice, when necessary, of Facilities Services and EHS concerning the proper handling and disposal of universal chemicals. Transport Universal waste to Fleming Warehouse for disposal. Receive proper training on Universal waste management Faculty, staff and students Faculty, staff and students who generate universal waste need to place the waste in appropriate collection containers, as assigned by the Recycling Coordinator. Guidance Types of universal waste There are four major types of Universal waste that are disposed of on campus  Batteries, such as  lead acid, nickel-cadmium (Ni-Cd), lithium, and mercury batteries. Alkaline batteries are not included. Lamps including but not limited to  fluorescent, HID, neon, mercury vapor, high pressure sodium, and metal halide. Facilities Services recycles all types of bulbs and lamps (even green tipped lamps) with the exception of incandescent. Some pesticides (EHS disposes of pesticides and pesticides are not landfilled). Non-PCB Containing Ballasts. Some non-PCB containing ballasts contain a Ni-Cad battery  therefore, these must be managed as a battery. Although mercury containing devices, such as thermometers and thermostats, can be managed as a universal waste, UT Knoxville manages this as a hazardous waste through EHS. Management Below are guidelines of how each type of Universal waste must be managed at UT Knoxville. Environmental Health and Safety manages the content of this document, however Facilities Services manages the operations of Universal Waste management. For more information about universal waste recycling, contact the Recycling Manager at Facilities Services at 974-3480. Lamps Maintenance personnel must store all lamps in closed boxes and labeled with a Universal waste label as soon as lamps are added to the box or container. The accumulation start date must be added to the Universal waste label when waste bulbs are first placed in the boxes. Lamp collection boxes must remain closed at all times, except when adding bulbs. Boxes should not be stored outside or exposed to the weather. Used and new lamps must not be mixed during storage. Lamps must not be forced into the boxes, which could result in breakage. Lamps must be safely transported to the Fleming Warehouse and stacked on the appropriate pallet, based upon box size.   Lamps must not be broken intentionally, and broken and unbroken lamps should not be mixed. If a lamp is broken, wear nitrile gloves and place all contents into a trash bag or box. Label with a Universal waste label that is dated, a transport to Fleming and place in the    broken bulb    drum. If individuals besides maintenance personnel generate universal waste lamps, contact Facilities Services at 974-3480 for guidance on how to manage this waste properly. Batteries All sealed lead acid, Ni-Cd, and rechargeable batteries MUST be recycled. Batteries must be accumulated in recycling buckets.   Battery recycling buckets are available for departmental and office use. To obtain a battery recycling bucket, to have it emptied, or to recycle individual batteries contact 974-3480 or email recycle@utk.edu. Batteries must be accumulated and then taken to one of the areas listed below. Also, the maintenance personnel in each building on campus have buckets for recycling batteries. You can give your batteries to them for recycling as well. Main Campus Battery Bucket Locations  University Center Computer Store Walter   s Life, near 4th fl. Elevator in F corridor SERF, 6th floor near 3-section recycling bin and elevator Nielsen Physics Room 204 Forest Products Center Neyland Biology Annex, room 128 Andy Holt Tower, room 201 Buehler, room 215 Kingston Pike Building, near loading dock Building Services, room 206e South Stadium Hall, room 250 McClung Tower, room 915 Stokely Athletic Center, room 246 Stokely Athletic Center, room 166 Stokely Athletic Center, room 259 Ayres Hall, room 227 Maintenance personnel must place sealed lead acid batteries and rechargeable batteries in battery collection buckets or boxes with the terminals taped. Containers must be labeled with a    universal waste    label, which may be obtained from the Environmental Coordinator. The label must have an accumulation start date. The collection bucket must remain closed except when adding batteries. Full containers of batteries must be transported to Fleming Warehouse, and placed on the appropriate battery pallet. Boxes on the pallet must remain closed. Do not clean up material that has leaked from batteries. Contact your supervisor, or call Environmental Health and Safety at 974-5084 to clean up leaking battery spills. Wear gloves and place the leaking battery in a bag or trash liner before placing it in the battery bucket. Ballasts The Facilities Services Department recycles magnetic ballasts and electronic ballasts. If the ballasts are PCB Containing Ballasts, then those are managed as a TSCA waste. Non-PCB Containing Ballasts are managed as Universal waste. PCB ballasts must be collected and stored in separate buckets, or containers, from non-PCB ballasts, and also separate from non-PCB ballasts containing ni-cad batteries. The battery-containing ballasts should be treated as batteries and placed in appropriate containers for batteries. PCB ballast buckets must be labeled with a yellow or white TSCA marking (which can be obtained from the Environmental Coordinator) and remain closed at all times. The marking must be labeled with the Out of Service date, which is the date in which the PCB ballasts were first accumulated in the bucket. Non-PCB ballast buckets must be labeled with a Universal waste sticker and also labeled with the accumulation start date. Ballasts are only considered non-PCB if    No PCBs    is printed on the ballasts. Ballasts with no indicator must be assumed to contain PCBs. Full buckets of ballasts should be safely transported to Fleming Warehouse and the contents emptied into labeled 55 gallon drums or Gaylord boxes on the appropriate pallet. 55 gallon drums must be dated and remain closed at all times. There are two drums or Gaylord boxes for ballast collection PCB containing ballasts (ALWAYS collected in a steel drum) Non-PCB containing ballasts (typically collected in a Gaylord box) Leaking Ballasts  Do not clean up the material that has leaked from ballasts. Maintenance personnel should contact their supervisor, or call Environmental Health and Safety at 974-5084 to clean up leaking ballasts. Wear gloves to change out the leaking ballast and place ballast in a bag or trash liner before placing it in the ballast recycling bucket. When doing large scale fixture upgrades where it is impractical to remove all ballasts contact Facilities Services or EHS for guidance on ballast disposal. Pesticides Universal waste regulations apply to persons managing pesticides that meet the following conditions  Recalled stocks of suspended and canceled pesticides that are part of a voluntary or mandatory recall under Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Section 19(b), or a pesticide that is not in compliance with FIFRA, that are part of a voluntary recall by the registrant. Stocks of other unused pesticide products that are collected and managed as part of a waste pesticide collection program. Universal waste pesticides become waste  On the date that the manufacturer of the recalled pesticide agrees to participate in the recall and the person conducting the recall decides to discard the pesticide, or When the handler decides to discard the unused pesticide. For questions concerning proper Universal waste management of pesticides, contact EHS or Facilities Services. EHS manages the disposal of pesticides. Mercury Containing Devices Thermostats Any used or unused mercury containing device or thermostat becomes a waste on the date that it is no longer operable or on the date that the handler decides to discard it. To manage a mercury containing device or thermostat as a Universal waste, the following requirements must be met  Mercury containing devices or thermostats that show any sign of leakage, spillage, or damage that could cause spillage must be stored in a container that is closed, compatible with the type of waste, and free of defects that could cause a leakage. Ampules containing mercury may be removed from a mercury containing device if  The ampule is removed such that breakage of the ampule does not occur  The ampule is only removed over a containment device  A mercury clean-up system is readily available  Any spilled mercury from a broken ampule is immediately transferred to an appropriate container  The area where the ampule is removed is well ventilated and monitored to ensure compliance with applicable OSHA exposure levels for mercury  Employees removing ampules are familiar with proper waste mercury handling and emergency procedures, including transfer of mercury from containment devices to an appropriate container  and Empty ampules are collected and stored in appropriate containers. If any waste is generated from a mercury-containing device, thermostat breakage or emptying of ampules (ampules themselves, spill clean-up debris, etc.), the waste handler must determine if it exhibits the characteristic of hazardous waste for mercury. If the waste does meet the characteristic, it must be managed as a hazardous waste. Mercury containing devices or mercury device storage areas must be labeled with the date that it was removed from service and one of the following     Universal waste     Mercury Containing Device(s)   , or     Universal Waste     Mercury Thermostats   .   Contact EHS at 974-5084 to pick up the device for proper disposal. Labeling In order to comply with state and federal regulations and University policy, the following information must appear on each container of Universal waste. Universal waste labels may be obtained from the Facilities Services Recycling Environmental Coordinator at 974-3480 or email recycle@utk.edu.  Universal waste   State and federal regulations require that each container be clearly marked with the words,  Universal waste . You may obtain Universal waste labels by contacting Facilities Services. Generator s Name and address  The individual who is responsible for the area or process from which the waste originated and the best person to contact if further information about the material is needed and their address. Accumulation Start Date  Universal waste must be dated with the date accumulation of the waste began. Storage Universal waste will be generated, stored, and disposed of within one year of the accumulation start date, as required by 40 CFR Part 273. Disposal The Recycling Coordinator will ensure that all Universal waste is disposed of properly. UT Knoxville requires that a Bill of Lading and a Certificate of Recycling from the destination facility be retained on file in the Facilities Services office. The Person(s) responsible for shipments of Universal waste (Recycling Coordinator) must request a Certificate of Recycling from the vendor. Recordkeeping  Most of the records, such as Bills of Lading and Certificates of Recycling, must be maintained for three years to meet regulatory requirements. However, to be prudent these records will be kept indefinitely. Training records shall be maintained by the individual department or responsible unit to whom the employee or student reports. Training records may also be kept in IRIS. Training and Information Requirements All employees who handle or have responsibility for managing Universal wastes must be informed of the proper handling and emergency procedures appropriate to the types of Universal wastes handled at the facility. Contact Facilities Services or EHS for assistance. Facilities Services must provide training and all supervisors must ensure that all individuals (staff, faculty and students) under their control who generate Universal waste shall ensure these individuals have been trained. Training is available from Facilities Services in the form of traditional classroom, or by self-study.

Guidance This guideline covers absorbent materials, such as kitty litter or vermiculite, pigs, rags, towels, etc. to clean up oils, grease, solvents, etc. Some areas on campus use shop towels, rags and wipes to clean up spills. If the shop towels are reused and laundered, then the towels do not need to be managed as hazardous waste and disposed. If a laundry service is used, please make sure that the shop towels are free of liquids before laundering. However, if the shop towels containing oil, solvents, or other potentially hazardous substances are disposable, then steps need to be taken to ensure this waste is properly being managed. The first step is identifying if the absorbents are hazardous or non-hazardous waste. Rags, Shop, Towels and Absorbents contaminated with oil and grease (including cooking oil)  Rags, towels and absorbents contaminated with oil and grease are not considered hazardous waste, unless they are contaminated with a listed solvent (see Table 1 below). If small quantities of oily shop towels or absorbents are generated, then these can be discarded in the municipal trash. However, if waste oily rags and absorbents are generated on a regular basis, then a waste collection container needs to be set up in the work area. The container should be lined with a compatible liner (such as a clear plastic bag), properly labeled as oily rags, and closed when not in use. Even though absorbents contaminated with oil are not classified as hazardous waste, they still need to be managed properly, according to EPA   s used oil regulations found in 40 CFR Part 279. EHS can be contacted to help set up a collection container and advise on properly managing   and disposing this waste. There are several options for waste disposal. EHS can be contacted for guidance and questions. This guideline covers both maintenance shops, as well as kitchens on campus which could generate absorbent waste from cooking oil and grease. If an oil spill is large (more than one gallon), or enters a storm drain, please contact EHS at 974-5084 and or the fire department and evacuate the area. The spill should be contained as soon as possible. There are various locations on campus where spill kits are stored for use in the event of a spill. Absorbents contaminated with Listed and Characteristic Solvents  Absorbents contaminated with the following F-listed solvents listed in Table 1 are classified as hazardous waste and must be managed according to all RCRA regulations. These must be stored in a closed container when not in use and properly labeled as hazardous waste with a UT hazardous waste label. Once the container is filled, EHS should be contacted to dispose of the hazardous absorbent waste. If you are unsure if the solvent being used contains an F- listed solvent, then start by reviewing the SDS sheet. If you are still unsure, please contact EHS for guidance. Table 1  F-Listed Solvents  acetone benzene n-butyl alcohol carbon disulfide carbon tetrachloride chlorinated fluorocarbons chlorobenzene cresols and cresylic acid cyclohexanone o-dichlorobenzene 2-ethoxyethanol ethyl acetate ethyl benzene ethyl ether isobutanol methanol methyl ethyl ketone methyl isobutyl ketone methylene chloride nitrobenzene 2-nitropropane pyridine tetrachloroethylene toluene 1,1,1-trichloroethane 1,1,2-trichloroethane trichloroethylene trichlorofluoromethane 1,1,2-trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane xylene Absorbents that have been used to clean up spills of    characteristic    hazardous waste (flammable solvents such as gasoline  corrosive liquids) are not classified as hazardous waste if   they   are   not   contaminated   with   listed   solvents   (see   list   above).   Characteristic waste includes four major categories  corrosives, flammables, reactive and toxic waste. Also, if a de minimus spill of hazardous waste occurs (meaning an insignificant non-routine release), the absorbents used to clean up the spill may not be considered hazardous waste, unless the release involves an acute compound (40 CFR 261.33(e)), which is found in the list of acutely toxic compounds found at www.ehs.utk.edu. However, absorbents used to clean up characteristic hazardous waste must be treated as hazardous if they are saturated (which means liquid can be squeezed from the rags), or if there are any free liquids at the bottom of the waste container. If you are not sure, please contact EHS to make sure the waste absorbents are being properly managed. When storing absorbents, make sure you do not pour any excess liquids (i.e. oil) into the collection container and do not allow absorbents containing hazardous waste to air-dry. Any free liquids generated should be managed as a separate hazardous waste stream. Make sure they are stored in a closed, properly labeled container. If the absorbents contain flammable solvents, the containers should be sufficiently separated from all external sources of ignition and    No Smoking    signs must be legible and placed in all accumulation areas. Cutting Oil and Fluids  There is a possibility that absorbents used to clean up cutting oils and fluids contain halogenated compounds, or other solvents, such as acetone and toluene, that are classified as listed waste. Also, it is important to review the processes the cutting oil is involved in, because there might be some other factors, such as metal shavings, that could cause the absorbents to become hazardous waste. For example, there could be metal shavings present containing lead, chromium, etc that are managed as hazardous waste by RCRA. In those cases, those absorbents should be managed as hazardous waste. If unsure of what types of compounds are present in the cutting oil review the SDS sheet to make a determination. If still unsure, please contact EHS for assistance. Absorbents Contaminated with PCB oil  Rags used to clean up spills involving PCB Liquids ( 50 ppm) are not defined as hazardous waste under RCRA. However, they should be managed according to TSCA regulations. They should be placed in a container and labeled with a PCB marking. The out of service date (which is the date the spill was cleaned up), should be written on the outside of the container. If a PCB liquid spill is cleaned up, please contact EHS as soon as possible to provide assistance in properly managing this waste. Best Management Practices for Managing Rags and Absorbents  Make sure   to   keep   lids   closed   on   containers   with   absorbents   to   prevent   spills   or evaporation. Substitute non-hazardous chemicals whenever possible, instead of using hazardous solvents. Repair leaks as soon as possible, and use drip pans and draining pans to prevent spills. Explore other methods of cleaning up spills, including brushing, vacuuming and dry wiping. Use funnels when pouring used oil or solvents into waste drums to reduce the chance of spills. Use a reusable absorbent pad to clean out sumps and oil water separators, and carefully wring it out completely before reusing it. Do not mix absorbents used for hazardous spill cleanup to clean up non-hazardous spills. Mixing of the two could result in the entire mixture becoming hazardous. Make sure that absorbents containing incompatible materials are stored separately (i.e. acids and bases, flammables and oxidizers). Recordkeeping Safety data sheets should be maintained indefinitely. The department is responsible for maintaining any training the employee received concerning used oil and hazardous waste management. All manifests, bills of lading, LDRs, or any other paperwork dealing with hazardous waste shipment and disposal must be kept a minimum of three years from the shipment date. Training and Information People who generate used oily rags should take Used Oil Management training. This can be offered by request from EHS. In addition, anyone who generates rags and absorbents containing hazardous materials should take Hazardous Waste Management training. Please contact the Training Coordinator in EHS at 974-5084 for more information.

Safety Contacts The Safety Contact is the primary contact for Laboratories that do not use hazardous chemicals. He she is instrumental in communicating elements of this protocol and lab safety in general. The primary role in the audit process is to work with EHS Lab Safety personnel to clearly communicate the expectations and logistics of the audit process and to follow up with labs with a risk level that warrants a re-audit prior to the next audit cycle. Procedures Introduction Laboratory audits are required by the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) Laboratory Standard and serve as key elements of UTK   s policy to ensure that a safe, healthy working environment is provided for students, faculty, staff and visitors. Laboratory PIs or supervisors have the responsibility of maintaining their laboratory area in a manner that controls hazards and minimizes risk. Scheduling Audits shall be scheduled so as to minimize disruption of laboratory activities. Lab personnel are required by this policy to give feedback on the audit schedule in order to align all parties involved and confirm engagement in the audit process. Under certain circumstances such as a filed complaint or an OSHA violation, an unannounced laboratory audit may occur. Notice of Laboratory Audit Prior to the audit of a laboratory, a notice will be sent to PIs in a selected department that have research labs under their purview. The notice will inform the PI of an upcoming audit and outline the evaluation criteria. The notice will contain a calendar with the schedule of pre- assigned audit dates and times for each PI in the department. Copies of the Notice of Laboratory Audit will be sent to the Department Head or Research Center Director, the Associate Dean for Research of the College, the Assistant Vice Chancellor for Research and Engagement and the Director of EHS. A response by the PI to the notice is required to confirm receipt and acceptance of the assigned schedule. The PI is asked to suggest an alternative date and time for the audit of each laboratory if the pre- assigned time is not suitable. If a response is not received, the audit will be conducted on the pre-assigned date time and the Department Head will be notified that the audit was conducted without the engagement of the PI or his her designee. Laboratory Audit The laboratory audit will involve  Meeting with the PI to discuss the specific work performed in the laboratory, the people working in the laboratory, and the types of materials and procedures used. Surveying the laboratory based on the pre-set criteria outlined in the notice of upcoming laboratory audit, using either the laboratory audit form or focused variations of the form. Answering any questions the PI or designated staff member may have regarding the audit and informing them that a written report of the audit findings will be forwarded to them in the near future with a copy to the relevant departmental, college, laboratory, and safety personnel. Laboratory Audit Report Each laboratory audit will be documented in a laboratory audit report and the reports will be maintained to identify laboratory hazards, recurrent problems, and hazard risk remediation that have been completed.   Copies of the report will be sent to the Principal Investigator of the laboratory being audited, the Department Head or Research Center Director, the Chemical Hygiene Officer or Safety Contact, the Director of EHS, and laboratory personnel assisting in the audit. Follow-Up Re-Audit If a laboratory is found to be deficient in an area that results in a major or minor finding, it will be pointed out to the PI who accompanies the Environmental Health and Safety staff member during the audit. If there is a need for corrective action in any laboratory, the PI will adhere to the response appropriate to the finding  Finding Significance Response to Finding Major Finding Immediate Risk to Life and Health. Examples are  High risk hot work  High inhalation hazard   chemicals being   worked   with outside the fume hood  conductor exposed on power cord  High risk use of pyrophoric chemicals  Reaction     scale-ups     without     the     proper     risk assessment and controls  Poor housekeeping that poses an immediate risk of injury or exposure  other activities or processes at the discretion of the auditor Numerical value = 0 points per major finding Immediate corrective action is required High risk lab work is suspended up to and including a    stop work    order on the entire lab until a solution is implemented or the high risk is mitigated A written corrective action plan (*CAP) is required within three business days. Completion of corrective action plan items from the full audit or a progress report is required within 10 days. A re-audit by EHS of the major findings will occur after 10 days of the original audit Minor Finding Serious Risk Examples are  Multiple damaged power cords, open containers of waste, incompatible chemical storage  labels missing from chemicals  poor housekeeping that may create a serious hazard  other activities or processes at the discretion of the auditor Numerical value = 1 points per minor finding A written corrective action plan is required within three business days. Completion of corrective action plan items from the full audit or a progress report is required within 10 days. A re-audit by EHS or the Department Head or his her designee will occur after 10 days of the original audit or during the next audit cycle as warranted by risk Observation Low risk non-compliance. Examples are  one cord with damaged outer coating  inadequate chemical labeling  poor housekeeping that doesn   t pose an immediate hazard  other activities or processes at the discretion of the auditor Numerical value = 2 points per observation A written corrective action plan is required within three business days. Completion of corrective action plan items from the full audit or a progress report is required within 10 days. A re-audit will occur during the next audit cycle Recommendation In compliance but not best practice. Potential for degrading into non- compliance Numerical value = 2 points per recommendation Evaluated at next audit cycle. Best Practice Benchmark program element Numerical value = 4 points per best practice acknowledgement The program element will be re-evaluated for sustainability during next audit cycle *CAP - The corrective action plan (CAP) must include the action items that will address the findings and the dates when the action items will be completed. Escalation The annual laboratory safety audit results in an email transmitting the audit report from the EHS Laboratory Safety Specialist to all affected PIs, the Department Head or Research Center Director, the Chemical Hygiene Officer or Safety Contact, the Director of EHS and the relevant lab personnel assisting with the audit. This report will indicate any safety compliance issues found during the audit.   The protocol for escalation of each audit level is listed below  Major Findings If major findings have been discovered in the laboratory, the Director of EHS will be notified during or immediately after the audit is completed.   If the PI was not present or was non- responsive to the request to suspend high risk lab work, the Director of EHS will notify the PI that the audit has resulted in major findings and immediate action will be required. If the PI is responsive, and agrees to cease the operations that resulted in the major finding, the PI will then begin to follow the response plan outlined in the table above.   If the PI is not responsive, the Director of EHS will notify the Assistant Vice- Chancellor of Research.   In the absence of the Assistant Vice-Chancellor of Research, the EHS Director will notify the Associate Dean of the College.   The implementation of the escalation process at this point will be determined by the College Administrators and the Office of Research and Engagement.   Copies of the audit report will be sent to appropriate levels of administration based on the escalation process. Minor Findings If minor findings have been discovered in the laboratory, the audit report will request a response plan according to the table above.   If no corrective action plan is provided within the stated period, the audit findings will be escalated according to the Major Findings protocol above, possibly leading to a    stop work    for that process or laboratory. Observations During the first audit cycle, observations will not be escalated. If the observations have not been mitigated or eliminated during the next audit cycle, they will be escalated according to the Minor Findings protocol. Recommendations Not escalated. Best Practices Best practices will be compiled at the end of each audit cycle and made available for other labs to use as benchmarks. Departmental Summary At the completion of each department   s audit cycle, a summary report for the department   s audits will be sent to the Department Head or Research Center Director, the Associate Dean of the College, the Assistant Vice Chancellor of Research and Engagement, the affected PIs, the Chemical Hygiene Officer or Safety Contact and the Director of EHS. The summary will include, at a minimum, a synopsis of the major and minor findings revealed during the audits, the individual labs that require follow-up by departmental personnel and departmental best practices. Recordkeeping Audit reports, transmission emails, and any documentation of follow up activities will be kept by EHS and the affected PIs. Training and Information No specific training is required by this policy  however, all attempts shall be made to communicate the audit protocol to the campus research community. Communication pathways may include  LSC - Laboratory Safety Committee Other Committees Office of Research and Engagement Chemical Hygiene Officers Safety Contacts Safety training provided by EHS Direct emails to affected parties Other methods References 29 CFR 1910.1450 OSHA Laboratory Standard Disclaimer The information provided in these guidelines is designed for educational use only and is not a substitute for specific training or experience.

Have written lead compliance program which describes the activities that may generate lead dust and fumes and what preventative measures will be taken during such activities to control exposure to their workers and University employees (29CFR1926.62)  Be responsible for providing medical surveillance, training and personal protective equipment for their own employees Ensure that outside contractors who disturb lead based paint have EPA lead based paint certifications for individual workers as well as the firm. Plans Programs Routine Inspections and Findings  EHS will inspect buildings on campus annually and look for materials or processes that could potentially contain lead and lead-based paint that may be in poor condition. EHS will inspect any child-occupied facilities on campus every six months that contain lead-based paint to determine if the paint is in poor condition and ensure any issues are corrected. Other groups on campus that conduct inspection and encounter materials that may contain lead should contact EHS for proper management Complaints  EHS shall investigate complaints involving lead. Sampling may be necessary to determine the presence of lead and if any hazards exist. Results of the findings and any recommendations shall be communicated to the complainant. Record shall be kept of the complaint, including final disposition. Routine Work with Lead  Employees and faculty who will be working with lead or lead containing items should consult EHS for appropriate controls (ventilation, decontamination, personal protective equipment, etc). EHS must ensure that, if any employees are generating lead dust or fumes, the fumes do not exceed the levels of lead exposure specified in the OSHA Action Levels. Fumes above these levels require air monitoring. Lead Abatement Projects  When lead paint must be abated in target housing or child-occupied facilities (as defined by TSCA it must be performed by lead workers and supervisors certified by the State of Tennessee. Renovation Projects  Project planners are encouraged to contact EHS during the planning stages of renovation projects to determine the presence of lead and appropriate controls. EHS shall be a consulted for proper disposal of lead and lead-containing materials. Disposal of Lead  Individuals wishing to dispose of lead or lead-containing debris should contact EHS regarding proper management. Worker Protection  Personal Hygiene Practices Even when airborne lead exposure levels are low, the potential exists for significant lead ingestion due to poor personal hygiene practices.   No eating, drinking, application of cosmetics (including lip balm) or smoking is permitted at work sites where lead and lead-based paints are being disturbed.   Workers shall wash their hands, arms and faces prior to eating, drinking, applying cosmetics or smoking. When chemical strippers are used to remove lead-based paint, appropriate impermeable gloves and chemical resistant clothing shall be worn for worker protection as well as safety goggles or face shields to protect the eyes from chemical splashes.   Portable eye wash equipment must be available on site, if applicable.     The area where the chemical stripper is being used must be well ventilated to avoid exposure to potentially toxic vapors. Engineering Controls When any person is performing an activity that may generate lead dust or fumes (i.e., demolishing, scraping, sanding, abrasive blasting, welding, cutting, torch burning, etc. on surfaces coated with lead-based paint), engineering controls shall be used. Engineering controls include, but is not limited to, work area separation with plastic sheeting, placing the work area under negative air pressure, misting the air to minimize dust levels, etc.). All means necessary to keep exposure below the permissible exposure level shall be followed. Respiratory Protection Workers engaged in lead work will require respiratory protective equipment when industrial hygiene air monitoring indicates anticipated exposures in excess of the PEL. The use of respiratory protection shall be in accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.134, Respiratory Protection, and UT   s Respiratory Protection Program.   All workers must be medically evaluated to determine the ability of the individual to perform the work while wearing a respirator.   Training in the care, use and fitting of the respirator in addition to fit-testing is conducted by EHS for those employees who are authorized to wear a respirator. Any worker who is not authorized to wear a respirator will be prohibited from engaging in activities which may expose the worker to airborne lead if exposures are anticipated to exceed the OSHA permissible exposure level. All employee respirators worn at the work site must be placed in a plastic bag prior to leaving the site and thoroughly cleaned before being worn again.   Cleaning should include inspection of the respirator and replacement of worn parts.   Fit-checks should be done each time the respirator is worn. The medical exam, fit-test and training must be repeated annually for those exposed above the PEL. Respirators shall be selected as follows  Airborne concentration of lead Required respirator1 Not in excess of 50   g m3 Half-mask air-purifying respirator equipped with high efficiency filter2,3. Not in excess of 250   g m3 Full face piece, air-purifying respirator with high efficiency filters3. Not in excess of 500   g m3 (1)   Any powered, air-purifying respirator with high efficiency filters3  or (2)   Half-mask supplied-air respirator operated in positive-pressure mode2. Not in excess of 1000   g m3 Supplied-air respirators with full face piece, hood, helmet, or suit, operated in positive pressure mode. Greater than 1000   g m3, unknown concentration or fire fighting Full face piece, self-contained breathing apparatus operated in positive-pressure mode. Respirators specified for higher concentrations can be used at lower concentrations of lead. Full face piece is required if the lead aerosols cause eye or skin irritation at the use concentrations. A high efficiency particulate filter means 99.97 percent efficient against 0.3 micron size particles. Disturbance of lead paint surfaces within a building s interior should only occur under proper work controls.   Methods of controlling lead exposure to other occupants may include isolating the area by use of plastic sheeting and sealing all ventilation ducts in the area of the work and or turning off and securing the ventilation system (lockout-tag out).     Other methods to minimize distribution of lead dust may include wet sanding and the use of HEPA vacuum cleaners. Occupational Exposure to Lead     Exposure Assessment  If there are any employees who perform work that may generate lead dust or fumes, an initial assessment will be made to determine if employees will be exposed to lead at or above the Action Level or PEL and to determine the number of days per year the worker will be involved in this activity. OSHA personal air monitoring will be conducted on employees performing activities that may generate lead dust or fumes. Employees will be notified of the results of the monitoring. Should the Action Level or PEL be exceeded, medical surveillance and training will be triggered (see Section 5.4). Medical Surveillance  In the unlikely event that an employee is exposed above the OSHA Action Level or PEL for 30 or more days per year, UT will  conduct a medical examination of the employee annually  perform a blood test to determine the level of lead in blood  if blood lead levels are equal to or greater than 40 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood, an annual medical exam will be provided  and Remove employee from the activity that created the elevated blood level if levels stay above 40   g mL. Exposure Monitoring  Exposure monitoring should be conducted for maintenance activities involving the disturbance of lead-based paint, unless the same type of job has been assessed previously.   In this case, a review of the previous assessment can be used to decide if additional monitoring is necessary. Notification to Building Occupants Prior to the initiation of any large scale interior or exterior work involving lead-based paint, Facilities Planning or Facilities Services will forward lead-based paint information to the appropriate department chair or director. This bulletin will contain the general scope of work to be done, dates for the start and proposed completion of the work, and the precautions which will be employed to protect building occupants. This bulletin will also alert staff to the increased hazard that lead contamination may present for pregnant or nursing women. Based on a determination by the Project Manager in consultation with EHS, further measures to reduce potential lead exposure will be taken if necessary. Signage Warning signs shall be posted at each job site where the employees exposure to lead is above the PEL. Where an exposure assessment has not been completed, signs shall be posted until the results are known. The signs shall consist of the following wording  WARNING HAZARD LEAD WORK AREA NO SMOKING, EATING, OR DRINKING Recordkeeping The following records shall be kept as part of this program Training for lead awareness (keep on IRIS, or in dept.) Training for lead remodeling, repair and painting program (kept by EHS) Lead-paint inspector training and certification (kept by EHS) Lead-paint risk assessor training and certification (kept by EHS) Sampling results, including bulk sampling, air sampling and any biological monitoring (kept by EHS) Inspection and testing results (kept by EHS) Complaint results (kept by EHS) Material Safety Data Sheets, or Safety Data Sheets (kept by EHS) Medical evaluation for lead exposure (kept by Employee Health) Records falling under a, b, c, e and f of this section shall be kept for at least three years.   Records from d, g, h and i above shall be kept indefinitely. Training and Information Awareness General awareness training shall be provided to all employees who are likely to disturb lead or work with lead-containing materials. Training may be provided by EHS, or by Facilities Services, on-line self-study, or other means and may be incorporated as part of the OSHA Hazard Communication program, OSHA Chemical Hygiene Plan or the OSHA Lead Standard (29 CFR 1910.1025). Awareness training shall be available via self-study, online (EHS website, UT on-line or Skillsoft) or upon request. Employees shall be trained of the following information  Health hazards associated with lead exposure  Lead routes of entry  Locations of lead materials and lead-based paint on campus  Approved methods of working with lead-based paint  and Methods of self-protection Inspectors and Risk Assessor EHS shall have at least one employees who is trained as lead- paint inspectors and at least one employee who is a lead-paint risk assessor. Lead Remodeling, Repair and Painting Program (RRP) EHS shall provide training to UT employees who may conduct remodeling, repair and painting in child-occupied facilities and target housing. Contractors Contractors performing renovation, maintenance, repair, and similar activities shall have proof of certification under the EPA RRP program and from the State of Tennessee for all workers and supervisors who do lead abatement, and renovation, repair and painting on campus. In addition, contractors whose workers are exposed to lead must present a copy of their Lead Compliance Plan, as required by RCRA, and must maintain good work practice controls to minimize lead exposure to their workers. Contractors are required to provide their workers with the proper PPE, respirators, air monitoring, medical surveillance and any other requirements as defined by OSHA.

Mercury-Properties and Health Effects Mercury is a naturally occurring element that is found in air, water and soil. It exists in several forms  elemental or metallic mercury, inorganic mercury compounds, and organic mercury compounds. Because of its unique properties, mercury has many applications in industry. Elemental mercury is a shiny, silver-white metal that is liquid at room temperature, and is used in thermometers, fluorescent light bulbs and some electrical switches. Inorganic mercury compounds (in the form of salts), are typically used as fungicides, antiseptics or disinfectants. Organic mercury compounds, such as methyl mercury, are formed when mercury combines with carbon. Microscopic organisms convert inorganic mercury into methyl mercury, which is the most common organic mercury compound found in the environment. Exposure to excessive levels can permanently damage the brain and kidneys. Organic compounds of mercury, such as methyl mercury, are considered the most toxic forms of the element. Inhalation of elemental mercury vapor is the most common route of exposure. When mercury is spilled or allowed to come into contact with air (i.e. mercury thermometer breaks), it evaporates. Heated mercury evaporates at a much faster rate, resulting in a significantly greater risk of exposure. Absorption of elemental mercury through the skin can cause allergic reactions. Direct contact of mercury to the skin can lead to dermatitis. Roles and Responsibilities Mercury-Disposal and Regulations Mercury is a persistent threat to the environment. Mercury accumulates in the tissue of fish and exposes birds and mammals that eat the fish. This, in turn, causes mortality (death), reduced fertility, slower growth and development and abnormal behavior that affect survival, depending on the level of exposure. The EPA targets mercury as one of the top Persistent Bio-accumulative Toxic (PBT) chemicals being reduced on a global scale. In addition, mercury is listed by the EPA as one of the 31 priority chemicals that EPA is pushing to substantially reduce or eliminate production. The typical household mercury thermometer contains enough mercury in it to contaminate a 20-acre fish pond!! Mercury is regulated by the EPA as a hazardous waste. Mercury cannot be dumped down the sanitary or storm sewers, or thrown in the regular trash. Mercury waste must be managed according to all federal, state regulations and UTK   s hazardous waste management program. All mercury waste should be brought to EHS for disposal. Mercury waste generated at UTK is typically shipped for disposal to a mercury recycler to be reused in new products, which is now a requirement in the State of Tennessee. Options to Consider Regarding Mercury Waste Reduction In many cases, there are cost effective alternatives for mercury that have been developed and are readily available. The following methods should be evaluated for use to reduce the amount of mercury waste generated on campus. Mercury spills from broken thermometers are the number one type of hazardous waste spill at the University, so EHS strongly encourages people to bring their mercury thermometers to EHS and replace them with a non-mercury alternative. A significant amount of money is spent each year by EHS to clean up these spills. Micro-chemistry or using reduced volumes Mercury Recycling Substitution with a non-hazardous or less hazardous material (see list below for ideas) Avoid mixing mercury waste with non-hazardous waste Spill prevention Limiting quantities of chemicals and consumer products purchased with mercury.

EHS shall  Provide training to individuals who will issue permits. In coordination with supervisors, review and approve UTK   s hot work program on an annual basis, or when regulations or policies are changed. Provide regulatory assistance to supervisors, employees and contractors concerning Hot Work. Contractors shall  Ensure their employees follow UTK   s Hot Work policy. Ensure that permits are obtained for any hot work being performed and are updated on a daily basis. Note that permits are not necessary for construction projects that are solely under the control of the contractor and do not impact any UT occupied facilities. Ensure that proper conditions exist to allow safe performance of hot work and following precautions listed on the permit. Program Activities Prior to Work Before hot work operations begin in a non-designated location, a completed hot work permit is required. The permit is to be completed 48 hours prior to the start of the work (exceptions made on an emergency basis) and is valid for one day and one area, and should be posted in the area of hot work for the duration of the activity. An example of a Hot Work permit can be found in Appendix A. The following conditions must be confirmed by the Supervisor and or PAH before permitting the hot work to commence  Equipment (e.g. welding equipment, shields, personal protective equipment, fire extinguishers) must be in satisfactory operating condition and in good repair. The floor must be swept clean for a radius of 35 ft. if combustible materials, such as paper or wood shavings are on the floor, Combustible floors (except wood on concrete) must be kept wet or be covered with damp sand ( note  where floors have been wet down, personnel operating arc welding or cutting equipment shall be protected from possible shock)., or protected by noncombustible or fire-retardant shields. All combustible materials must be moved at least 35 ft away from the hot work operation. If relocation is impractical, combustibles must be protected with fire-retardant covers, shields or curtains. Edges of covers at the floor must be tight to prevent sparks from going under them, including where several covers overlap when protecting a large pile. Openings or cracks in walls, floors, or ducts within 35 ft of the site must be tightly covered with fire-retardant or noncombustible material to prevent the passage of sparks to adjacent areas. If hot work is done near walls, partitions, ceilings, or roofs of combustible construction, fire-retardant shields or guards must be provided to prevent ignition. Fully charged and operable fire extinguishers that are appropriate for the type of possible fire shall be available immediately at the work area. These extinguishers should be supplied by the group performing the hot work. The fire extinguishers normally located in a building are not considered to fulfill this requirement. If hot work is done in proximity to a sprinkler head, a wet rag shall be laid over the head and then removed at the conclusion of the welding or cutting operation. During hot work, special precautions shall be taken to avoid accidental operation of automatic fire detection or suppression systems (for example, special extinguishing systems or sprinklers). Nearby personnel must be suitably protected against heat, sparks, and slag. Prohibitions Hot work shall not be permitted in the following areas until the conditions prohibiting hot work have been modified  In the presence of explosive atmospheres, or in situations where explosive atmospheres may develop inside contaminated, improperly prepared tanks or equipment which previously contained flammable liquids. In areas with an accumulation of combustible debris, dust, lint and oily deposits. In areas near the storage of exposed, readily ignitable materials such as combustibles. On a container, such as a barrel, drum or tank that contained materials that will emit toxic fumes when heated. In a confined space, until the space has been inspected and determined to be safe. Refer to UTKs    Confined Space Procedure. In cases when an entire building fire detection system is shut down. In buildings with sprinkling systems while such protection is impaired. Hot work shall not be attempted on  A partition, wall, ceiling or roof that has a combustible covering or insulation, or on walls or partitions of combustible sandwich-type panel construction. Pipes or other metal that is in contact with combustible walls, partitions, ceilings or roofs shall not be done if the work is close enough to cause ignition by conduction. Personal Protective Equipment The welder shall be equipped with protective devices and or apparel as indicated on the permit or as listed below  Portable and or mechanical ventilation capable of keeping the levels of fumes, dust and gases below the thresholds established in the Occupational Safety and Health Administration s (OSHA) Permissible Exposure Limits (PELs). If local exhaust or general ventilation are not available and fume, dust and gas generation is high, respirators shall be used  Gloves, apron and or jacket that are made of a material that is an insulator from heat and electricity  Welders helmets equipped with proper filter plate and cover lenses. Respiratory protection (NOTE  No employee shall be issued or be required to use a respirator until that employee has satisfied the criteria set forth in UTK   s Respiratory Protection Policy)  Screens to protect persons not properly protected from the visual effects of viewing arc welding or cutting and during gas or oxygen cutting or welding. Lifelines and harnesses for work in confined spaces as set forth in UTK   s Confined Space Policy. Fire Watch A fire watch will be required in the following instances  All Oxy-acetylene welding and cutting activities. Other welding where the operator wears eye-protection for welding. The eye protection will impair the operator   s ability to see detect when something may ignite. The fire watch does not have to be limited to performing no other duties, however he may not leave the area of welding and his primary duty must be to detection and prevention of fires. Example  a welder and his helper-the helper can assist the welder, but may not leave the area to get supplies unless the welder stops and performs the duties of fire watch. NOTE  A person assigned to fire watch cannot perform any other duties while they are doing fire watch. Work Closeout  A fire watch shall be maintained for at least 30 minutes after completion of hot work operations in order to detect and extinguish smoldering fires. The PAI shall inspect the job site 30 minutes following completion of hot work and close out the permit with the time and date of the final check. Designated Hot Work Rooms A designated hot work room is a permanent location designed for hot work. These rooms do not require a permit to perform hot work. For a room to be classified as a designated hot work room, it must meet the following requirements  It must be of noncombustible fire-resistant construction, essentially free of combustible and flammable contents. It must be suitable segregated from adjacent areas. It must be equipped with fire extinguishers. It must be approved and inspected by EHS. Adequate ventilation based on the welding technique, base metal, coating, rod and other factors Operations not requiring a hot work permit Examples of operations that do not require a hot work permit include  Bunsen burners in labs Fixed grinding wheels Electric soldering irons If unsure whether an operation is considered hot work, please contact EHS or a supervisor. Confined Spaces The following precautions are in addition to the requirements of a confined space entry program and must be followed when performing hot work in a confined space  To prevent accidental contact, when arc welding is to be suspended for any substantial period of time, such as during lunch or overnight, all electrodes shall be removed from the holders and the holders carefully located so that accidental contact cannot occur and the machine be disconnected from the power source. In order to eliminate the possibility of gas escaping through leaks or improperly closed valves, when gas welding or cutting, the torch valves shall be closed and the gas supply to the torch positively shut off at some point outside the confined space area whenever the torch is not to be used for a substantial period of time, such as during lunch hour or overnight. Where practical, the torch and hose shall also be removed from the confined space. When welding or cutting is being performed in any confined space, the gas cylinders and welding machines shall be left on the outside. Before operations are started, heavy portable equipment mounted on wheels shall be securely blocked to prevent accidental movement. Training The following information will be covered during training  The importance of safe hot work procedures  A summary of the OHSA Welding, Cutting, and Brazing standard (29 CFR 1910.252) and of the NFPA 51B standard. An overview of UTK   s written Hot Work Program. An explanation of how EHS can assist departments. The inherent risks involved. Emergency procedures in the event of a fire. Instructions on all equipment and processes. Recordkeeping Hot work permits shall be maintained for one year after work has been completed. Training documentation will be kept for all affected employees indefinitely. EHS shall maintain all equipment calibration records indefinitely.

Post signs when an impairment of the fire protection system has occurred. EHS shall  Assist in training Fire Watch officers upon request. Revise the Fire Watch Procedure periodically. Outside Contractors shall  Notify Facilities Services when a fire protection system is impaired, either whole or partially. When hot work is being performed that requires a fire watch. Follow UTK   s fire watch procedure. Procedures Fire Watch Initiation  A building may be evacuated or an approved fire watch provided for all portions of a building or structure that  Lacks sufficient egress exits or Contains a serious fire hazard When required by the State Fire Marshal   s Office (SFMO) Other major code deficiencies such as but not limited to the following  Impaired fire protection equipment such as alarm, suppression, fire pumps Condition of age or dilapidated condition, or from any other cause, is especially liable to fire, or constitutes other dangerous of defective conditions, and that is situated so as to endanger life or property. This may also include combustible or explosive matter or inflammable conditions dangerous to the safety of such buildings. Personnel  A fire watch must included dedicated staffing, such as certified firefighters, trained security guard(s), or others subject to the approval of the SFMO to perform the watch. Fire watch officers must have the skills and ability to perform prescribed duties and to meet all job qualifications. Fire watch officers are not expected to perform fire-fighting duties beyond the scope of the ordinary citizen. The individuals performing the fire watch are not permitted to perform any other duties. Identification  Fire watch officers must be provided with a means of identifying themselves as authorized representatives of fire loss prevention management. The method of identification shall be acceptable to the authority having jurisdiction. Fitness for Duty  An on-duty fire watch officer shall not accept relief by another officer who is not in a condition to work. The on-duty fire watch officer shall ensure that the relief officer is fit for duty. It shall be the responsibility of management to determine fitness for duty for any fire watch officer. Emergencies on Duty  Fire watch officers shall not leave their assigned areas except in an emergency. In such cases, they should notify their superiors or another officer as soon as practicable or send an appropriate signal to a constantly attended location, such as the UT Police Department or the City of Knoxville Fire Department. Pre-Event Tour  A fire watch officer should conduct a tour before the fire watch to familiarize themselves with the building or area they are assigned. Fire Watch  What to look for While on duty, fire watch officers should pay particular attention to the following when conducting a fire watch inspection of the building  Fire alarm panel  Make sure there are no yellow or red lights, unless the system is impaired. Sprinkler system  all water flow control valves should be open, unless the system is impaired, and sprinkler heads should not be obstructed. Fire pump Hot Operations  if welding, torch cutting, heavy grinding or other hot work is being performed. Potential arson-accelerant  forced entry. Flammable Liquids  Must be in approved containers and in designated storage areas. Pull stations  the fire watch officer should know where these are located and how to activate. Fire extinguishers  fire watch officers should know the location of all portable extinguishers and how to use them. Fire extinguishers should only be used if safe to do so. Exits  fire watch officers should know where all exits are located and all exit doors should be accessible for use. Fire Doors  should be closed properly. Out of Service Equipment  Fire protection systems (i.e. fire detection or suppression systems) that are impaired must be tagged out of service. Tags must be placed at the fire alarm panel, main sprinkler valve and the fire department connection. Communication  Fire watch officers must be provided with a means of continuous communication (e.g. two way radios) with a constantly attended location.     There may be some locations (i.e. basements) on campus where two-way radios may not work.     Therefore, alternative arrangements need to be made in those circumstances. Cell phones, or landlines might be used instead, or a second person might be assigned to assist with communication. Directory  A continuously updated directory of names, telephone numbers, and other information to assist in making emergency calls shall be kept at a fire watch control center. This directory shall include the telephone numbers of key management personnel to be notified in an emergency, such as fire, police, and emergency medical service departments, and other outside agencies needed in an emergency. In the absence of a fire watch control center, the directory should be kept in a location accessible to the fire watch officers. Route  The route assigned to the areas of concern for the fire watch officer shall be designated by management and approved by the SFMO. Each tour shall include an inspection of the outside perimeter of the building. Particular attention should be given to new construction or alterations that may be in progress. During the tour, the fire watch personnel shall make a thorough inspection of the buildings or spaces including concealed areas, such as attics, unoccupied storage areas, etc. Length of Patrol  Patrols of the facility are required every 15 minutes if the facility has people sleeping or is an occupied assembly facility. Otherwise, one complete tour of the building or area, no longer than one hour, shall be completed.   If the tour cannot be completed in one hour by a single fire watch officer, additional fire watches shall be posted. Report  Fire watch officers must complete a daily report identifying the fire watch staff on duty, the time(s) of patrol, any events or deficiencies discovered, and the corresponding resolution. The fire watch must be maintained the entire time the building is occupied or until the deficiencies are corrected. If Fire Occurs  Alert Fire Department  A fire watch officer must notify the City of Knoxville Fire Department immediately in the event that a fire occurs. Evacuate Occupants of the Building  If smoke or fire is detected, pull the nearest alarm. If safe, check rooms for occupants along the evacuation route. Evacuate to the assembly point. Remain on the scene to assist with the emergency. Keep people calm and together. Start a sign-in sheet at the assembly point Communicate with on-scene responders (fire department or police) regarding who may be left in the building, if there are any injuries and details about the incident. Keep others from approaching or entering the building until approval to re-enter has been provided by the police or fire department Cancellation of Fire Watch  A fire watch can be cancelled only after the alarm deficiencies have been repaired, or ALL occupants have been relocated to another facility. Hot Work  A fire watch may be required when hot work is being performed (see EHS Hot Work Policy FS 15 for more information). Potential situations that could exist which require a fire watch include  Hot work is performed in a location where other than a minor fire might develop or where the following conditions exist  Combustible materials in building construction or contents are closer than 35 ft to the point of hot work and can   t be shielded or covered. Combustible materials are more than 35 ft away but are easily ignited by sparks. Wall or floor openings are within 35 feet and expose combustible materials in adjacent areas. This includes combustible materials concealed in walls or floors. Combustible materials are adjacent to the opposite side of partitions, walls, ceilings, or roofs and are likely to be ignited. Recordkeeping All reports and records will be maintained by the department issuing the fire watch a minimum of three years.

Reviewing, updating, and conducting PPE hazard assessments whenever a job changes new equipment is used there has been an accident where PPE have been a factor a supervisor or employee requests it or periodically as needed Employees The PPE user is responsible for following the requirements of the PPE policies.   This involves Properly wearing PPE as required. Attending required training sessions. Properly caring for, cleaning, maintaining, and inspecting PPE as required. Following the University of Tennessee   s PPE policies and rules. Informing the supervisor of the need to repair or replace PPE and report problems when they are encountered. General Requirements The OSHA standard requires the employer conduct and document a hazard assessment. A work area assessment (Appendix A) is required to determine if any potential hazards exist and select the appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) for adequate protection. A hazard assessment form must be completed for each job title and maintained in the employee   s department   s file. A copy of this assessment form is available from EHS. Employees must receive training, which includes the proper PPE for their job, when PPE must be worn, how to don doff, adjust, maintain, proper disposal of PPE, and the limitations of the PPE. All training must be documented (Appendix B). PPE is not a substitute for more effective control methods and its use will be considered when other means of protection against hazards are not adequate or feasible.   EHS can provide guidance with the work hazard assessment and can assist with PPE training upon request. Once the workplace hazards have been identified, the supervisor will determine if the hazards can be eliminated or reduced by methods other than PPE (engineering and or administrative controls).   If those methods are not feasible, then the supervisor will determine the suitability of the PPE presently available, and as necessary, will select new or additional equipment which ensures a level of protection that meets or exceeds NIOSH, ANSI and other standards and regulatory requirements. Care will be taken to recognize the possibility of multiple and simultaneous exposure to a variety of hazards. Adequate protection against the highest level of each of the hazards will be recommended for purchase.   All PPE and equipment will be of safe design and construction, and will be maintained in a sanitary and reliable condition.   Affected employees whose jobs require the use of PPE will be informed of the PPE selection and will be provided PPE for use.   Careful consideration will be given to the comfort and proper fit of PPE in order to ensure that it will be used. EHS can provide guidance and can assist the supervisor in proper PPE selection if requested. This section addresses general PPE requirements, including eye and face, head, foot and leg, hand and arm and body (torso) protection. Separate programs exist for respiratory protection and hearing protection as the need for participation in these programs is established. Types of Personal Protective Equipment Eye and Face Protection  Employees and students shall wear the appropriate eye and face protection when involved in activities where there is the potential for eye and face injury from  Handling of hot solids, liquids, or molten metals. Flying particles from chiseling, drilling, sawing, cutting, etc. Intense non-ionizing radiation from gas or electric arc welding, torch brazing, oxygen cutting, laser use, etc. Handling of chemicals and gases. Potential for biological exposure. Appendix D includes a list of common workplace activities performed by employees and the proper eye and face protection equipment needed for each activity. For more guidance, please contact EHS. The most common types of eye protection used in the workplace are listed below. Eye Protection Safety Glasses Ordinary prescription glasses do not provide adequate protection. Eye protection must conform to the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), Standard Z87.1-1989 or latest edition. Look for this stamp on the inside of the safety glass frame. Prescription safety glasses are recommended for employees who must routinely wear safety glasses in lieu of fitting safety glasses over their personal glasses. All safety glasses must have side shields. Whenever protection against splashing is a concern,    Chemical Splash Goggles    must be worn. For more guidance on safety glasses selection, please contact EHS. Goggles Goggles are intended for use when protection is needed against chemicals or particles. Impact protection goggles, which contain perforations on the side of goggle, are not to be used for chemical splash protection. Splash goggles, which contain shielded vents at the top of the goggle, are appropriate for chemical splash protection, and also provide limited eye impact protection. Face Shields Face shields must not be used as the sole source of protection for eye hazards. Full-face shields provide the face and throat with partial protection from flying particles and liquid splash. For maximum protection against chemical splash, a full-face shield should be used in combination with chemical splash goggles. Face shields are appropriate as secondary protection when implosion (e.g. vacuum applications) or explosion hazards are present. Face shields, which are contoured to protect the sides of the neck as well as frontal protection, are preferred. Eye Protection for Non-ionizing Radiation The radiation produced by welding covers a broad range of the spectrum of light. Exposure to ultraviolet light (UV-B) from welding operations can cause    welders flash   , a painful inflammable of the outer layer of the cornea. Arc welding or arc cutting operations, including submerged arc welding, require the use of welding helmets with an appropriate filter lens. Goggles with filter plates or tinted glass are available for operations where intense light sources are encountered, including but not limited to, gas welding or oxygen cutting operations. Spectacles with suitable filter lenses may be appropriate for light gas welding operations, torch brazing, or inspection. Hand Protection Employees shall use hand protection when exposed to hazards including  Skin absorption of harmful substances Lacerations Severe cuts Severe abrasions Chemical burns Thermal burns Harmful temperature extremes Gloves made from a wide variety of materials are designed for many types of workplace hazards. In general, gloves fall into four groups  Gloves made of leather, canvas or metal mesh Fabric and coated fabric gloves Chemical and liquid resistant gloves Insulating rubber gloves (See Electrical Policy and 29 CFR 1910.137) They are discussed in greater detail below Leather, Canvas or Metal Mesh Gloves Sturdy gloves made from metal mesh, leather or canvas provide protection against cuts and burns.     Leather or canvass gloves also protect against sustained heat. Leather gloves protect against sparks, moderate heat, blows, chips and rough objects. Aluminized gloves provide reflective and insulating protection against heat and require an insert made of synthetic materials to protect against heat and cold. Aramid fiber gloves protect against heat and cold, are cut- and abrasive-resistant, and wear well. Synthetic gloves of various materials offer protection against heat and cold, are cut- and abrasive-resistant and may withstand some diluted acids. These materials do not stand up against alkalis and solvents. Fabric and Coated Fabric Gloves Fabric and coated fabric gloves are made of cotton or other fabric to provide varying degrees of protection. Fabric gloves protect against dirt, slivers, chafing and abrasions. They do not provide sufficient protection for use with rough, sharp or heavy materials. Adding a plastic coating will strengthen some fabric gloves. Coated fabric gloves are normally made from cotton flannel with napping on one side. By coating the unnapped side with plastic, fabric gloves are transformed into general-purpose hand protection offering slip-resistant qualities. These gloves are used for tasks ranging from handling bricks and wire to chemical laboratory containers. When selecting gloves to protect against chemical exposure hazards, always check with the manufacturer or review the manufacturer   s product literature to determine the gloves    effectiveness against specific workplace chemicals and conditions. Chemical and Liquid Resistant Gloves Chemical-resistant gloves are made with different kinds of rubber  natural, butyl, neoprene, nitrile and fluorocarbon (Viton)  or various kinds of plastic  polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyvinyl alcohol and polyethylene. These materials can be blended or laminated for better performance. As a general rule, the thicker the glove material, the greater the chemical resistance but thick gloves may impair grip and dexterity, having a negative impact on safety.   Appendix E lists types of chemical and liquid gloves, as well as their advantages and disadvantages.   Appendix F lists several chemicals and recommends the type of chemical resistant glove that should be used when handling that specific chemical. Some examples of chemical-resistant gloves include  Butyl rubber gloves are made of a synthetic rubber and protect against a wide variety of chemicals, such as peroxide, highly corrosive acids (nitric acid, sulfuric acid, hydrofluoric acid and red-fuming nitric acid), strong bases, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, esters and nitro compounds. Butyl gloves also resist oxidation, ozone corrosion and abrasion, and remain flexible at low temperatures. Butyl rubber does not perform well with aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons and halogenated solvents. Natural (latex) rubber gloves are comfortable to wear, which makes them a popular general-purpose glove. They feature outstanding tensile strength, elasticity and temperature resistance. In addition to resisting abrasions caused by grinding and polishing, these gloves protect workers    hands from most water solutions of acids, alkalis, salts and ketones. Latex gloves may cause allergic reactions in some individuals and may not be appropriate for all employees. Hypoallergenic gloves, glove liners and powder less gloves are possible alternatives for workers who are allergic to latex gloves. Neoprene gloves are made of synthetic rubber and offer good pliability, finger dexterity, high density and tear resistance. They protect against hydraulic fluids, gasoline, alcohols, organic acids and alkalis. They generally have chemical and wear resistance properties superior to those made of natural rubber. Nitrile gloves are made of a copolymer and provide protection from chlorinated solvents such as trichloroethylene and perchloroethylene. Although intended for jobs requiring dexterity and sensitivity, nitrile gloves stand up to heavy use even after prolonged exposure to substances that cause other gloves to deteriorate. They offer protection when working with oils, greases, acids, caustics and alcohols but are generally not recommended for use with strong oxidizing agents, aromatic solvents, ketones and acetates. There are no ANSI standards for gloves. However, selection must be based on the performance characteristics of the glove in relation to the tasks to be performed.   Wear proper hand protection whenever the potential for contact with chemicals, sharp objects, or very hot or cold materials exists. Select gloves bases on the properties of the materials in use, the degree of protection needed, and the nature of the work (direct contact necessary, dexterity needed, etc.). Leather gloves may be used for protection against sharp edged objects, such as when picking up broken glassware or inserting glass tubes into stoppers. When working at temperature extremes, use insulated gloves. When considering chemical gloves, note that chemicals will permeate glove materials. The permeation rate varies depending on the chemical, glove material, and thickness. Double gloving is recommended when handling highly toxic or carcinogenic materials. Before each use, inspect the gloves for discoloration, punctures and tears. Before removal, wash gloves if the glove material is impermeable to water. Observe any changes in glove color and texture, including hardening or softening, which may be indications of glove degradation.   For more information on glove selection, visit the Ansell web-site at  http   www.ansellpro.com download Ansell_7thEditionChemicalResistanceGuide.pdf, or contact EHS for guidance. Body Protection  Employees working around hazardous materials or machinery shall not wear loose clothing (e.g. saris, dangling neckties, necklaces) or unrestrained long hair. Loose clothing, jewelry, and unrestrained long hair can become ensnared in moving parts of machinery or contact chemicals. Finger rings can damage gloves, trap chemicals against the skin and be an infection control issue. Cotton lab coats (preferable to rayon or polyester coats) should be worn to protect clothing from becoming soiled and to provide limited protection against minor splashes of chemicals, biological materials, and radioactive materials.   Lab coats with button closure are preferred over zipper closer, since these are easier to remove in case of an emergency. Assure that hazardous chemicals, radioactive materials, or toxic dusts are not carried home by using lab coats, disposable protective clothing, or work clothes which remain at the workplace. Tyvek coveralls can be used over street clothes for protection against particles and low hazard liquids. However, this will not resist liquid penetrations, and if splashed with chemicals, should be removed immediately. Vinyl or rubber aprons and sleeves should be used when dispensing corrosive liquids (e.g. hydrofluoric acid, phenol, etc.). When using metal organic liquids or other materials which may self-ignite on contact with air are used, Nomex lab coats are recommended, along with face shields. Where contact with hazardous materials with your protective clothing is likely, such as during spill cleanup or pesticide application, polyethylene-coated Tyvek or similar clothing should be used to provide additional protection. The limitations of the protective clothing must always be understood particularly in situations where contact with the material is likely. Employees should know the appropriate techniques for removing protective apparel, especially any that has become contaminated. Special procedures may need to be followed for cleaning and or discarding contaminated apparel. Chemicals spills on leather clothing accessories (watchbands, shoes, belts, and such) can be especially hazardous because many chemicals can be absorbed in the leather and then held close to the skin for long periods. Such items must be removed promptly and typically be discarded to prevent the possibility of chemical burns. Note that flame resistance should be considered when selecting whole body protection. Source of ignition could include open flames, arcs, sparks, chemicals, radiation energy and more. Protective clothing comes in a variety of materials, each effective against particular hazards, such as  Paper-like fiber used for disposable suits provide protection against dust and splashes. Treated wool and cotton adapts well to changing temperatures, is comfortable and fire-resistant and protects against dust, abrasions and rough and irritating surfaces. Duck is a closely woven cotton fabric that protects against cuts and bruises when handling heavy, sharp or rough materials. Leather is often used to protect against dry heat and flames. Rubber, rubberized fabrics, neoprene and plastics protect against certain chemicals and physical hazards. When chemical or physical hazards are present, check with the clothing manufacturer to ensure that the material selected will provide protection against the specific hazard. Occupational Foot Protection  Safety footwear shall conform to the requirements and specifications of ANSI Z41.1-1991 or latest edition,    Men   s Safety-Toe Footwear.    Wear proper shoes, not sandals or open toed shoes, in work areas where chemicals are used or stored. Perforated shoes, sandals or cloth sneakers should not be worn in areas where mechanical work is being done.   Safety shoes are required for protection against injury from heavy falling objects (handling of objects weighing more than fifteen pounds which, if dropped, would likely result in a foot injury), against crushing by rolling objects (warehouse, loading docks, etc.), and against laceration or penetration by sharp objects.   Pullovers, worn over regular shoes, are available for protection against certain chemicals. These boots are made of a stretchable rubber compound and are well suited for cleaning up chemical spills. Foot and leg protection choices include the following  Leggings protect the lower legs and feet from heat hazards such as molten metal or welding sparks. Safety snaps allow leggings to be removed quickly. Metatarsal guards protect the instep area from impact and compression. Made of aluminum, steel, fiber or plastic, these guards may be strapped to the outside of shoes. Toe guards fit over the toes of regular shoes to protect the toes from impact and compression hazards. They may be made of steel, aluminum or plastic. Occupational Head Protection  Employers must ensure that their employees wear head protection when any of the following apply Objects (such as tools) that might fall from above and strike them on the head Fixed objects, such as exposed pipes and beams Accidental head contact with electrical hazards. In general, protective helmets or hard hats should do the following  Resist penetration by objects. Absorb the shock of a blow. Be water-resistant and slow burning. Have clear instructions explaining proper adjustment and replacement of the suspension and headband. Hard hats are divided into three industrial classes  Class G hard hats provide impact and penetration resistance along with limited voltage protection (up to 2,200 volts). Class E hard hats provide the highest level of protection against electrical hazards, with high-voltage shock and burn protection (up to 20,000 volts). They also provide protection from impact and penetration hazards by flying falling objects. Class C hard hats provide lightweight comfort and impact protection but offer no protection from electrical hazards. Another class of protective headgear on the market is called a    bump hat,    designed for use in areas with low head clearance. They are recommended for areas where protection is needed from head bumps and lacerations. These are not designed to protect against falling or flying objects and are not ANSI approved. It is essential to check the type of hard hat employees are using to ensure that the equipment provides appropriate protection. Each hat should bear a label inside the shell that lists the manufacturer, the ANSI designation and the class of the hat. Hard hats must have a hard outer shell and a shock-absorbing lining that incorporates a headband and straps that suspend the shell from 1 to 1 1 4 inches (2.54 cm to 3.18 cm) away from the head. This type of design provides shock absorption during an impact and ventilation during normal wear. Helmets designed to protect the head from impact and penetration from falling flying objects and from limited electric shock and burn shall meet the requirements and specifications established in ANSI Z89.1-1986 or latest edition,    Requirements for Industrial Head Protection   . Upon inspecting the equipment, if the employees find the following signs of deterioration, then the hard hat should be taken out of service  Suspension system (head band and straps) no longer holds the shell from 1 inch to 1    inches away from the employee   s head Cracking, tearing or graying of the lining (head band and straps) The brim or the shell show signs of chalking, flaking, or loss of surface gloss Employees working in higher elevations, such as aerial lifts, need chin straps for their helmets. Use of stickers should be limited for use on hard hats, since they hide deterioration and other defects. Paints, paint thinners and cleaning agents can weaken the shell of a hard hat and may eliminate electrical resistance. Ultraviolet light and extreme heat can reduce the strength of the hard hats. Therefore, employees should not store or transport hard hats in direct sunlight. Manufacturer   s specifications must be followed with respect to cleaning. Electrical Protection  Specific design, performance, use, and care requirements apply to protective equipment used for isolation against electrical hazards. Persons responsible for the purchase, maintenance, and use of such equipment (insulating blankets, matting, covers, line hose, gloves, and sleeves made of rubber) must be familiar with these requirements (refer to 29 CFR 1910.137 and the Electrical Safety Program (EHS Safety Manual, GS-070) Fall Protection  See the Fall Protection Policy of this Health and Safety manual for more information. (EHS Safety Manual, GS-041). Respiratory Protection  See the Respiratory Protection Policy of this Health and Safety manual for more information. (EHS Safety Manual, IH-003) Hearing Protection  See Hearing Conservation Requirements for more information. (EHS Safety Manual, IH-010) Selection, Maintenance, and Assessment Selection Guidelines The general procedure for the selection of PPE is as follows  Become familiar with the potential hazards and the type of PPE that is available, and its function. Compare the hazards of the work environment with the capabilities of the PPE. Select the PPE which ensures a level of protection greater than the minimum required to protect the employee from the hazards. Fit the user with the PPE and give instructions on care and use of the PPE. Ensure that the employees are made aware of all warning labels for and limitations of their PPE. Cleaning and Maintenance of PPE  It is important that all PPE be kept clean and properly maintained.   Cleaning is particularly important for eye and face protection where dirty or fogged lenses could impair vision.   Employees must inspect, clean, and maintain their PPE according to the manufacturers    instructions before and after each use (see attached).   Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that users properly maintain their PPE in good condition. Personal protective equipment must not be shared between employees until it has been properly cleaned and sanitized. PPE will be distributed for individual use whenever possible.   If employees provide their own PPE, make sure that it is adequate for the work place hazards, and that it is maintained in a clean and reliable condition. Defective or damaged PPE will not be used and will be immediately discarded and replaced. It is also important to ensure that contaminated PPE which cannot be decontaminated is disposed of in a manner that protects employees from exposure to hazards. Reassessment of Hazards  It is the responsibility of the supervisor to reassess the workplace hazard situation a necessary, by identifying and evaluating new equipment and processes, reviewing accident records, and reevaluating the suitability of previously selected PPE. Training The supervisor shall provide adequate training to each employee who is required to use PPE. Each employee shall be trained to know at least the following  When PPE is necessary What PPE is necessary How to properly don, doff, adjust, and wear PPE The limitations of the PPE The proper care, maintenance, useful life, and disposal of the PPE Each affected employee must demonstrate an understanding of the training provided, and the ability to use the PPE properly, before performing any work requiring the use of PPE. Show-and-tell competence demonstrations are appropriate for most situations. When the supervisor has reason to believe that an affected employee who has already been trained does not have the understanding and skill required the supervisor shall retrain the employee. Circumstances that render previous training obsolete or inadequate and therefore require new training or retraining include, but are not limited to  Changes in the workplace. Changes in the types of PPE to be used. Inadequacies in the affected employee   s knowledge or use of assigned PPE. The supervisor must verify that each affected employee has received and understood the required training through a written certification that must contain the name of each employee trained, the date(s) of training, and identify the subject of certification (e.g. Appendix B).

Definitions and Abbreviations Abbreviations FM     Factory Mutual OSHA     Occupational Safety and Health Administration NFPA     National Fire Protection Association SDS     Safety Data Sheets UL     Underwriters Laboratories Definitions Aerosol     A material which is dispensed from its container as a mist, spray, or foam propellant under pressure. Classified as a Class I flammable liquid. Boiling Point - The temperature at which a liquid   s vapor pressure is equal to   the atmospheric pressure. Liquids with low boiling points are very volatile. Bonding     The process of providing an electrically conductive pathway between dispensing container and a receiving container. Combustible Liquids     Liquids with flash points at or above 100oF. Combustible liquids are subdivided into Class II, IIIA and IIIB liquids. Fire Area     An area of a building separated from the remainder of the building by construction having a fire resistance of at least 1 hour and having all communicating openings properly protected by an assembly having a fire resistance rating of at least 1 hour. Flammable (Explosive) Limits Flammable (Explosive) Range     The terms flammable and explosive are used interchangeably since unconfined vapors mixed in air will burn while confined vapors will produce an explosion. The minimum vapor concentration in air that, when ignited, will propagate a flame is the lower flammable limit (LFL or LEL). The maximum vapor concentration in air that when ignited will propagate a flame is the upper flammable or explosive limit (UFL or UEL). Flammable Storage Cabinet     A    flammable storage cabinet    is an Underwriters Laboratory (UL), or Factory Mutual (FM) listed storage cabinet designed in accordance with National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 30 guidelines. Flash Point     The temperature at which a liquid gives off vapor sufficient to form an ignitable mixture with the air near the surface of the liquid or within the vessel used as determined by appropriate test procedure. Ground and Bonding Process     When flammable and combustible liquids travel through a pipe or through the air, static charges are accumulated.   Grounding and bonding is necessary during the transfer of Class I flammable liquids to prevent a static spark from igniting the flammable vapors. Safety Can     A metal container of not more than 5 gallon capacity which is UL FM Approved and is provided with a flame arrestor, a spring-closing lid and spout cover designed to relieve internal pressure when subjected to fire exposure. Vapor Density     The weight of a volume of pure vapor or gas (with no air present) compared to the weight of an equal volume of dry air at the same temperature and pressure. A vapor density figure less than one indicates the vapor is lighter than air. A figure greater than one indicates the vapor is heavier than air. Vapor Pressure     A measure of the pressure created by a liquid   s vapor at a specific temperature. Flammable or combustible liquids with a high vapor pressure at room temperature are more hazardous than liquids with lower vapor pressures because they will produce more flammable vapor without heating. Roles and Responsibilities Departments shall  Provide proper storage for flammable liquids. Ensure proper training is provided to employees and students who work with flammable liquids. Ensure containers are properly labeled and disposed. Supervisors shall  Provide adequate training in the use and storage of flammable liquids. Monitor for proper use and storage. Keep only the minimum amount required on hand. Ensure SDSs are current for all flammable liquids. Employees and Students shall  Follow all storage and use requirements. Report deficiencies in storage and use to supervisors. Immediately report spills to supervisors. EHS shall  Provide guidance and training on proper flammable storage usage and storage. Revise these guidelines as needed. Procedure Hazards Description Flammable and combustible liquids are easily ignited and difficult to extinguish. Combustible liquids require heating for ignition and are easier to extinguish. Flammable and combustible liquids produce a high heat release rate once ignited (i.e., fires produce high temperatures in a short period of time), and associated fires spread rapidly. Vapors from flammable and combustible liquids can be present at room temperature and can form explosive mixtures with air. Some liquids are unstable or very reactive (e.g., burn when exposed to air without an ignition source, susceptible to spontaneous heating, react violently with other materials including water). These characteristics combine to create a significant fire and or explosion hazard. Since the vapors generated from flammable liquids are most often heavier than air, they will seek the lowest available level in a building. This movement of vapors can produce potentially dangerous conditions far removed from the actual vapor source. Flammable vapor, if not removed by ventilation, can flow to an ignition source and flash back to the vapor source. The volatility of the liquid is increased when externally heated at or above its flash point. Overall, an increase in temperature will increase the hazard created by a flammable or combustible liquid by increasing its vapor   s flammable range. Due to this, heated Class II and Class III liquids should be subject to all applicable requirements for Class I and Class II liquids respectively. Combustible liquids vaporize and form flammable mixtures with air in open containers, when leaks occur, or when heated. To control these potential hazards, several properties of these materials, such as volatility, flashpoint, flammability range and auto ignition temperatures must be understood.   Information on the properties of a specific liquid can be found in that liquid   s safety data sheet (SDS), or other reference material.   NFPA 45 is the reference to determine the permissible amount of flammable liquids used in teaching and research laboratories. National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) hazard classifications for flammable and combustible liquids are listed below  NFPA Hazard classification for flammable liquids Class Flash point Boiling point Examples I-A below 73  F (23  C) below 100  F (38  C) diethyl ether, pentane, ligroin, petroleum ether I-B below 73  F (23  C) at or above 100  F (38  C) acetone, benzene, cyclohexane, ethanol I-C 73-100  F (24-38  C) ---- p-xylene Hazard classification for combustible liquids II 101-140  F (39-60  C) ---- diesel fuel, motor oil, kerosene, cleaning solvents III-A 141-199  F (61-93  C) ---- paints (oil base), linseed oil, mineral oil III-B 200  F (93  C) or above ---- paints (oil base), neat   s-foot oil Considerations for working with and storing flammable liquids  Know the locations of fire alarms, pull stations, fire extinguishers, safety showers, and other emergency equipment. Read the SDS for each flammable liquid prior to use and wear personal protective equipment as indicated in the SDS or the lab   s Chemical Hygiene Plan. If a building or departmental flammable solvent storage room with a fire suppression system is available, store flammable materials there until they are needed and remove only the amount necessary for a particular experiment or task. Store flammable liquids in a flammable storage cabinet. A variety of commercially manufactured cabinets are available. When flammable liquids must be stored outside a flammable storage cabinet, use approved safety cans whenever possible. They have spring-loaded lids and an internal screen which prevents combustion of the contents. Do not use large polypropylene ( Nalgene ) containers with stopcocks or valves at the bottom to store flammable liquids. These valves frequently leak and are unsafe in a fire. Never store flammable liquids in a standard or domestic refrigerator or freezer. Flammable liquids that must be chilled or frozen require specially designed  spark-proof  refrigerators or freezers. Minimize the amount of flammable liquids in your lab. Buy only what is needed in the immediate future, and buy the smallest size that you need. Excess flammable solvents risk a fire, a dangerous spill and, if you are exposed to them, your health. Unused surpluses create an unnecessary disposal cost for the University. Storage Limits for Chemicals  Avoid storing flammable liquids on high shelves or in direct sunlight. Store flammable liquids in a well ventilated area. Caution  Never use environmental rooms (also called cold warm rooms) to store flammable, combustible, or other hazardous materials. Environmental rooms have many ignition sources and little or no outside air circulation. You can use small quantities of flammable or hazardous materials (500 ml) in these spaces, but do not store them there. In the laboratory, store flammables in a UL-approved (or equivalent) flammable storage cabinet. Unless a cabinet is marked as approved for storage of flammable liquids, flammable solvents may not be stored there. In general, do not store flammable liquids in cabinets below fume hoods or sinks. Flammable liquids should be stored separately from strong oxidizers, corrosives and other incompatible materials. It is best to store flammable liquids in an approved storage cabinet dedicated solely for that purpose. Keep the flammable liquid containers closed when not in use. Storage of flammable liquids or other hazardous chemicals on floors should be extremely limited. When storage on floors is unavoidable, secondary containment bins that can contain at least 110% of the volume of the largest container being stored are required. Storage of flammable liquids must not block any route of egress. On the benchtop, limit the storage of flammable liquids to those in immediate use. Handle flammable chemicals in areas free from ignition sources. It is best to store bottles of flammable liquids in a tray or pan (secondary containment) to catch any spills, especially if chemicals are being stored on the floor. When working with open containers, use a laboratory fume hood to control the accumulation of flammable vapor. Use plastic trays when storing chemicals in freezers. This prevents the bottles from becoming embedded in ice and frost that often forms in freezers. It also contains spills and drips. Flammable Storage Cabinets With a flammable storage cabinet, the allowable quantities are doubled. Only certified cabinets listed by Factory Mutual, Underwriter s Laboratory, or other qualified testing agencies should be purchased. The requirements for a flammable storage cabinet are  Doors shall be well fitted, self-closing, and equipped with a latching device. All flammable storage cabinets must be clearly labeled with a sign that reads   Flammable     Keep Fire Away . Flammable storage cabinets should never be located by exit doors and located an appropriate distance from sources of ignition, sparks, or open flames including, but not limited to, cutting and welding frictional heat, static, mechanical sparks, or hot surfaces. Flammable storage cabinets should not be used to store corrosives, as they may corrode the cabinet. The venting of flammable storage cabinets is not recommended, as it reduces its fire protection effectiveness. If venting is required to prevent chemical exposure or to reduce odorous vapors, the installation has to be done by a qualified person. New cabinets shall be Underwriter   s Laboratory Factory Mutual Research Corporation approved or has verification of meeting NFPA 30 requirements. No more than three cabinets shall be grouped together in a single fire area. Shall not be used to store compressed gas cylinders along with flammable liquids. Such cabinets may be used to store only compressed gas cylinders. The total amount of liquids stored in one cabinet shall not exceed 60 gallons 227.1L) of Class I or II liquids or 120 gallons (454.2L) or Class III liquids. Refrigerators  Take precautions when storing flammable chemicals in a refrigerator.   Refrigerator temperatures may be higher than the flash points of flammable liquids.   Compressors and circuits are often located at the bottom of the refrigerator where vapors from small spills or leaks can accumulate.   Electrical sparks from a conventional refrigerator can then ignite the flammable vapors that build up inside.   Unless a cold room is ventilated and has a fire suppression sprinkler system, do not store flammable liquids there. Two kinds of refrigerators are approved for storage of flammables  Flammable liquid storage refrigerators. These have no spark sources within the refrigerator cabinet. There are, however, spark sources outside the refrigerator cabinet from switches, motors, relays, etc. These spark sources can ignite flammable vapors present outside of the refrigerator. A bottle of flammable liquid that drops and breaks near one of these refrigerators can easily be ignited by the sparks. Explosion-proof refrigerators. These refrigerators are considerably more expensive because they have all spark sources completely sealed inside and are safe for flammable atmospheres both within and outside of the refrigerator cabinet. Transferring Liquids  The main objective in working safely with flammable liquids is to avoid accumulation of vapors and to control sources of ignition. Besides the more obvious ignition sources, such as open flames from Bunsen burners, matches and cigarette smoking, less obvious sources, such as electrical equipment, static electricity and gas-fired heating devices should be considered. Some electrical equipment, including switches, stirrers, motors, and relays can produce sparks that can ignite vapors. Although some newer equipment has spark-free induction motors, the on-off switches and speed controls may be able to produce a spark when they are adjusted because they have exposed contacts. One solution is to remove any switches located on the device and insert a switch on the cord near the plug end. Pouring flammable liquids can generate static electricity. The development of static electricity is related to the humidity levels in the area. Cold, dry atmospheres are more likely to facilitate static electricity. Bonding or using ground straps for metallic or non-metallic containers can prevent static generation. Control all ignition sources in areas where flammable liquids are used. Smoking, open flames and spark producing equipment should not be used. Use bottle carriers for transporting glass containers. Use equipment with spark-free, intrinsically safe induction motors or air motors to avoid producing sparks. These motors must meet National Electric Safety Code (US DOC, 1993) Class 1, Division 2, Group C-D explosion resistance specifications. Many stirrers, Variacs, outlet strips, ovens, heat tape, hot plates and heat guns do not conform to these code requirements. Avoid using equipment with series-wound motors, since they are likely to produce sparks. Do not heat flammable liquids with an open flame. Steam baths, salt and sand baths, oil and wax baths, heating mantles and hot air or nitrogen baths are preferable. Minimize the production of vapors and the associated risk of ignition by flashback. Vapors from flammable liquids are denser than air and tend to sink to the floor level where they can spread over a large area. Do not distill flammable substances under reduced pressure. Splash proof goggles in addition to standard laboratory personal protective equipment (PPE) consisting of a lab coat, closed toe shoes and nitrile gloves should be worn while pouring flammable liquids. Pouring larger volumes may require additional PPE consisting of thicker gloves and an apron. Bonding and Grounding Always bond metal containers to metal receivers when transferring large volumes of flammable liquids or gases. Electrically bond metal containers when transferring flammable liquids from one to another. Bonding can be direct, as a wire attached to both containers, or indirect, as through a common ground system. When grounding non-metallic containers, contact must be made directly to the liquid, rather than to the container. In the rare circumstance that static cannot be avoided, proceed slowly to give the charge time to disperse or conduct the procedure in an inert atmosphere. Static electricity can ignite flammable gases or vapors. If static electricity is a problem, minimize static electricity by spraying with an antistatic agent. Use nonconductive materials (floors, mats, etc.) and grounding straps on instruments and machines, especially when transferring flammable chemicals between metal containers. These reduce the risk of generating static sparks. The greatest hazard from static electricity is in the winter when the air is dry. Additional Considerations  Flammable and Combustible Solids Flammable solids often encountered in the laboratory include alkali metals, magnesium metal, metallic hydrides, some organometallic compounds, and sulfur. Many flammable solids react with water and cannot be extinguished with conventional dry chemical or carbon dioxide extinguishers. Ensure Class D extinguishers are available where flammable solids are used or stored. Sand can usually be used to smother a fire involving flammable solids. Keep a container of sand near the work area. If a flammable, water-reactive solid is spilled onto skin, brush off as much as possible, and then flush with copious amounts of water. NEVER use a carbon dioxide fire extinguisher for fires involving lithium aluminum hydride (LAH). LAH reacts explosively with carbon dioxide. Catalyst Ignition Some hydrogenated catalysts, such as palladium, platinum oxide, and Raney nickel, when recovered from hydrogenation reactions, may become saturated with hydrogen and present a fire or explosion hazard. Carefully filter the catalyst. Do not allow the filter cake to become dry. Place the funnel containing moist catalyst into a water bath immediately. Purge gases, such as nitrogen or argon, may be used so that the catalyst can be filtered and handled in an inert atmosphere. Flammable Aerosols Flammable liquids in pressurized containers may rupture and aerosolize when exposed to heat, creating a highly flammable vapor cloud. As with flammable liquids, these should be stored in a flammable storage cabinet. Drums Containing of Flammable and Combustible Liquids Provisions shall be made for bonding and grounding while dispensing flammable or combustible liquids from drums. Drums with a capacity of 55 gallons or more shall be included in the Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures Plan (SPCC). One key element of this standard is secondary containment. Provisions for secondary containment should be made where multiple drums less than 55 gallon capacity are stored. Bungs shall be kept in place except when product is being added to or removed from the drum. Drum storage of flammable liquids generally necessitate the need for additional controls such as a fire suppression system, storage in a flammable liquid storage cabinet or fire-rated room. All drum shall be marked as to their contents. Inspections EHS shall inspect all facilities on an annual basis.   The management of flammable and combustible liquids shall be reviewed at this time.   Deficiencies shall be noted on the inspection report and communicated the appropriate individual for corrections. Recordkeeping EHS shall maintain records of all inspection reports and training records for a minimum of 10 years. Training EHS can provide general training on the use of flammable liquids upon request.

Always travel at least six feet away from buildings. Operators are to use extreme caution at all times. Stunt driving, excessive speed and horseplay are prohibited. Operators or passengers shall not jump on or off vehicles in motion. No passengers will be permitted on alternative vehicles unless provided with adequate seating. No one is permitted to ride on the running boards, fenders, or any part of the vehicle except the seats. Always remain seated and hold on while vehicle is in motion. Operators may not wear headsets, ear protection or other devices at any time which may impede their ability to operate the vehicle. Avoid sudden stops or change of direction that may result in a loss of control. Operators shall not stop in the middle of roads or walkways. Alternative vehicles are not to be driven or parked on landscape and lawn areas unless it is the only available way to allow a pedestrian the proper right-of-way. The vehicle should be brought to a full stop on the landscaped area, then immediately returned to the walkway as soon as the area is clear. DO NOT leave keys in unattended vehicles. Operators of alternative vehicles that will be used in remote areas are encouraged to consult the Offsite Safety Guide found in the UT Safety Manual. Vehicles operated after dark shall be equipped with headlights and tail lights. Speed Limit All speed limits shall be observed. When driving an alternative vehicle on a walkway during heavy pedestrian traffic, vehicle speeds shall be reduced to a walking pace. Operators must always consider the terrain, weather conditions, existing pedestrian and vehicular traffic that may require driving at slower speeds. Intersections and Crosswalks Operators must come to a complete stop before crossing a roadway or proceeding through intersecting sidewalks or other areas that have blind spots. Alternative vehicles cannot use pedestrian crosswalks to cross roadways. To avoid the use of pedestrian crosswalks, an operator may need to merge into the normal flow of traffic at a reasonable and prudent distance from the intersection.   This will allow the vehicle to safely cross the intersection without obstructing traffic, illegally using the pedestrian crosswalk or impeding the flow of traffic.   This is in accordance to the Tennessee Code Annotated 55-8-185, where off-highway motor vehicles are only allowed to drive on a road    at a place where a quick and safe crossing may be made.    When the vehicle is crossing the road, the operator must abide by the rules of the road. When making turns, the operator must signal using either a mechanical light turning signal or an arm turning signal. Operators must obey all traffic signals. Operators must look in all directions prior to entering the intersections and crossing. Slow down before and during turns. All turns shall be executed at reduced speeds. Pedestrians Pedestrians have the right-of-way on campus. Alternative vehicles must yield to pedestrians on sidewalks. Operators must account for the fact that a pedestrian may be physically impaired and unable to hear or see the vehicle, or unable to move quickly. Operators must reduce speeds in heavy pedestrian traffic or stop until the pedestrian traffic has lessened. Operators must never attempt to get pedestrians out of their way by intimidating them to step off the sidewalk. Whenever an operator feels he she cannot predict the actions of a pedestrian or other vehicle operator, he she must come to a complete stop before proceeding. Parking The department responsible for the unit vehicle is also responsible for locating a safe location to store the vehicle that does not block parking spaces or blocks ingress or egress. Keys shall be removed from the vehicle while it is unattended. Alternative vehicles shall not be parked within 10 feet of the entrance or exit of any building, except at loading docks. Alternative vehicles shall not be parked in a way that blocks fire hydrants, emergency exits, and vehicular or pedestrian traffic. Vehicles shall not be parked in fire lanes, in metered parking spaces, on sidewalks, in handicapped parking, impeding handicapped ramps or in reserved parking. Cargo Alternative vehicles equipped with a back carriage shall not be loaded in excess of the manufacturer   s rating. Overloading decreases maneuverability and safe operation. Materials and equipment shall be loaded and secured so they will not cause a hazard by shifting or falling off the vehicle. Top heavy equipment is especially dangerous and should be secured near the center of the vehicle to avoid tipping. Be extremely careful during turning maneuvers. Cargo must not extend more than one foot from either side or the front of a utility vehicle. Loads that extend more than three feet from the rear of the vehicle must be flagged with a brightly colored material, usually red or orange. Cargo such as pipe or ladders shall be secured mounted on proper rack systems. Extra precaution must be taken when transporting these types of cargo in order to prevent injury to nearby pedestrians. The operator must not exceed the recommended towing capacity of the ATV when towing trailers or trailer-mounted equipment. The operator must ensure the trailer will not over power the braking abilities of the ATV. Safe material handling practices shall be followed when transporting chemicals such as containers of fuel or pesticide spray tanks. All containers tanks must have spill-proof safety caps and be properly secured in the cargo area. General Guidelines Re-fuel and Battery Charging Re-fueling must be completed outdoors, away from any sources of ignition and at least 50 feet from building HVAC air-intakes. Smoking is prohibited when the vehicle is being re-fueled and within 15 feet of vehicles where battery charging is in progress. Battery charging shall be performed in areas with adequate ventilation. Approved flammable liquid storage cans must be used when re-fueling with portable containers. Refueling is prohibited with 20 feet of lawn and landscape areas. Electrical Mechanical Systems Vehicles must be inspected and maintained in accordance with manufacturer   s recommendations. Electrical or mechanical problems must be reported immediately by the vehicle operator to his her supervisor. Vehicles that are unsafe to operate (e.g. brake failure) shall be taken out of service and secured to prevent use until repairs are completed. ATVs Acquired After July 1, 2016 Alternative vehicles acquired after July 1, 2016 shall be through and delivered to Fleet Management. For use on public roads, all carts acquired after the effective date of this policy must meet the National Highway Safety and Traffic Administration (NHSTA) Standard 500 (49CFR Part 571.500), which is applicable to low-speed vehicles. The Standard 500 vehicles may also be known as neighborhood electric vehicles or NEV. The Standard 500 requires the cart be equipped with certain features including, but not limited to  Headlights (2) Front rear turn signals Rear stoplights  tail lamps Reflectors reflective tape - 360 degree visibility Mirrors - rear view driver side and either a passenger side rear view or interior rear view Parking Brake Windshield - DOT AS-1 or AS-4 identification Vehicle Identification Number     17 Digit Seat Belts     Either Type 1 (lap belt) or Type 2 (lap and shoulder harness) Certification Label     To indicate the Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) not to exceed 1,361kg. or 3,000 lbs. In addition to the items listed above, certain safety equipment such as flashing hazard lights, a strobe beacon light, doors and steering wheel locks may be specified by the University. The minimum safety equipment design specification on all non-Standard 500 carts must include  No fewer than four wheels touching the ground roadway at all times. All original equipment must be in good working order. The rear must have a reflective triangle, including trailers attached to a cart. If operated after dusk and before dawn, headlights, taillights and brake lights (2 of each). A yellow or amber flashing light(s) visible from 360 degrees shall operate while the vehicle is in motion. A horn with an activation button switch within reach of the driver. The vehicle must have an ignition on-off key to allow removal of the key to prevent unauthorized use. Parking-brake with adequate strength to hold the cart at least a 15 degree angle. Accident Reporting Procedure All accidents involving an Alternative Off-Road Vehicle will be reported immediately to the University of Tennessee Police Department and the department to which the vehicle belongs. Training and Recordkeeping Contractors shall assure that their employees are qualified to operate their alternative vehicles on campus streets It shall be the department head   s responsibility to ensure that vehicle operators are trained.   Authorized users of alternative vehicles shall successfully complete training prior to initial use of the vehicle.   Participants must score 80% or better on a post-training quiz in order to be considered    authorized.      Results of the quizzes shall be kept by the department and serve as documentation of training.     Environmental Health and Safety will provide training materials and quizzes for departments and or support (instructor). The quizzes along with Appendix A from this document will be graded and returned to the departments by EHS. EHS will maintain a central file online of individuals who have completed the training and assurance form. Refresher training may be required for individuals who have demonstrated poor skills, either by a history of accidents, observed violation of this policy or subject to enforcement action while operating an alternative vehicle. Initially, each operator must certify they have read and will comply with this policy. Enforcement ATV operators who violate this policy will be subject to monetary penalties as per existing Traffic and Parking Authority policy.   Departments may elect to pay the fine on behalf of the individual or may have the ATV operator pay the fine. The operator   s supervisor or department head will be notified when a ticket has been issued for an infraction. Policy Review and Revisions This policy shall be reviewed at least every three years and revised as needed by the Traffic and Parking Authority Committee.   More frequent review may be completed in response to regulatory changes, upon request or when deficiencies are noted. References Tennessee Code Annotated Title 55 Chapter 8.   55-8-185.

Effective Date  02 01 2014 Revision Date  11 01 2015 jump to appendices and forms   highlight  Purpose The purposes of these guidelines are to ensure that portable space heaters do not create a hazard to facility, employees, visitors or students. Scope and Applicability These guidelines shall apply to all portable space heaters used to provide additional heat and comfort over and above the facility   s heating system. Unfortunately, the use of these heaters increases the risk of fire and personal injury.   Employees cannot use portable space heaters unless they have completed an energy exception form and it is approved by Facilities Services.   Portable space heaters are a temporary solution, and not a permanent solution, to supplement the space   s heating needs. To apply for an exemption, an Environmental Exemption Request Form must be completed. This form may be downloaded online at http   fs.utk.edu Resources-nav Forms.html or requested by phone at 946-7777. Guidance Relevant Statistics  According to the National Fire Protection Association, space heaters contributed to 26% of all home fires in 2003, they were mostly deadly and accounted for 73% of fire deaths related to home heating. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) estimates that in 1994, electric space heaters were associated with 2,400 fires resulting 80 deaths, 240 injuries and $48.2 million in property loss. A typical 1500 watt electric heater, operating December-March for an 8 hour period 40 hours per week, consumes approximately 960 kW of energy at a cost of about $60, and generates over 1968 pounds of harmful greenhouse gases. For the above reasons, frequent use of space heaters is discouraged by the University. Selection of Heaters Only heaters that bear the label of Underwriter   s Laboratory (UL) are acceptable. Note other labels are accepted, provided the equipment has been tested by a nationally recognized testing laboratory. Heaters must be approved for the location where they will be used. Domestic- type fans should not be used in areas  containing flammable liquids Combustible dusts Highly corrosive atmosphere Wet location All portable heaters must be properly guarded. Portable space heaters are prohibited in laboratories. Portable space heaters are prohibited in residential halls. Open-coil space heaters, or space heaters that are fueled by kerosene, oil or produces an open flame, are prohibited. Automatic Tip-Over Shut-Off Function  The heater must be equipped with a safety tip-over shut-off function. This function will cause the appliance to automatically shut off if the heater should become overheated or is accidently tipped over. Heaters with unprotected elements are prohibited. Heater Use Heaters that have been damaged or are malfunctioning must be taken out of service. Portable space heaters must not be modified and any repairs must be performed     by qualified personnel. Heaters must be placed on stable, level surface. Heaters should not be placed underneath desks, in any means of egress (exit path), or any high traffic area. The use of any portable heater that is fueled by kerosene, or that produces open flame is strictly prohibited. Heaters should be placed a minimum of 3 feet from any combustible material (i.e. curtains, paper, cloth, etc.,) and in a well-ventilated area. Heaters should be inspected frequently. They should be inspected on a weekly basis at a minimum by the user to ensure they are in good working condition. Heaters must be turned off and unplugged when not in use and at the end of each business day. Heaters must be monitored during operation, and should not be placed in unattended areas, such as storage rooms or other unoccupied areas. Ensure heater is clean and not covered with dust before operation. Avoid placing portable heaters near room thermostats. Electrical Safety The power cord and any associated extension cord for the heater must be in good condition with no signs of damage. The power or extension cord should not  create a trip hazard be subject to excessive friction, crushing or wear run through a doorway, window, or under a carpet rug looped over a nail or other sharp surfaces placed in standing water subject to hazardous chemicals (acids, bases, solvents) that could degrade the insulation The power cord should be inspected periodically for damage to its insulation by the department that owns the fan. Note that Environmental Health and Safety checks (visual inspection) during routine hazard surveillance rounds. The space heater power cord directly affixed to the unit shall be plugged into a wall outlet. The use of extension cords with space heaters is prohibited.

Effective Date  01 01 2009 Revision Date  04 01 2014 jump to appendices and forms   highlight  Purpose This guideline has been developed to address falls and fall accidents that occur on the same walking surface, (interior and exterior) at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. Slip, trip and fall accidents are a common type of accident for all employers and can result in significant injury, especially for older individuals. A proactive approach to preventing these accidents includes identification of hazards, investigation of injuries, and correction of noted hazards. Scope and Applicability This guide should be used to protect students, staff, visitors and contractors from injury while on the UT premises or while on premises under the control of UT. Excluded from this plan are ladders, scaffolding, or elevated walking surfaces. Abbreviations and Definitions Abbreviations SGA     Student Government Association Roles and Responsibilities Employees, students and visitors shall  Wear proper footwear based on the work environment. Use prescribed exterior walkways and not take short cuts (e.g. down banks). Report any slip, trip or fall hazards to their immediate supervisor or Principal Investigator. Eliminate slip, trip and fall hazards where feasible. Examples include, moving a power cords that crosses a walkway, cleaning up spills, removing clutter, etc. Environmental Health and Safety shall  Eliminate or mark fall hazards where feasible. Provide technical assistance to departments regarding slip, trip and fall hazards. Investigate complaints involving slips, trip and fall hazards. Investigate accidents that involve a fall and where there may have been a contributing environmental factor such as missing handrail, slippery walking surface. Note that the Fall Hazard Investigation form (Appendix B) may be used to guide and document a fall investigation. Update and revise UT   s Slip, Trip and Fall policy periodically. Inspect facilities to identify fall hazards inside the building on an annual basis. Note that the exterior walking surfaces immediately adjacent to the building are inspected during this survey. Other exterior walking surfaces such as parking lots and sidewalks that are remote from the building are inspected annually by the SGA Safety Walk and by EHS on a triennial basis. Note deficiencies found during the annual inspection are communicated to the appropriate individual Department Heads and Supervisors shall  Identify work locations that are    Higher Risk Areas.    Properly address slip, trip and fall hazards promptly and consulting with EHS if a slip, trip and or fall hazard cannot be abated. Ensure appropriate training is provided for all employees who will be working in higher risk areas where slip, trip and fall hazards are prevalent. Evaluate employees    compliance with safe work practices. Eliminate slip, trip and fall hazards that fall under their control and have been reported Procedures Slip, Trip, & Fall Hazards  Slips occur when there is insufficient friction or traction between a person   s feet (foot wear) & walking working surface, resulting in loss of balance. Trips occur when the foot or lower leg hits an object and the upper body continues moving, resulting in loss of balance and also when stepping down to lower surface and losing balance. Falls occur when too far off center of balance Two types Fall at same level  Fall to same walking or working surface, or fall into or against objects above the same surface Fall to lower level  Fall to level below the walking or working surface Slips, trips and falls are the 2nd leading cause of accidental death (behind motor vehicle accidents).   Over 17% of all disabling occupational injuries that occur in the U.S. result from falls Factors, such as the ones listed below, all contribute to an increased risk of slip, trip and fall injury. Failing eyesight & or visual perception Age Physical condition & fatigue Stress or illness Medications, alcohol & drug effects Carrying or moving cumbersome objects or simply too many objects at one time Not paying attention to surroundings or walking distracted Taking unapproved shortcuts Being in a hurry and rushing Common slip, trip and fall hazards result from  Wet or contaminated floors (e.g. grease, liquids, ice, oil, dust fine powders, etc.). Contaminant Source(s) Rain water                     Transmitted internally from open external doors or from the feet, coats or umbrellas of pedestrians                     Building leaks Water, other fluids                     From spills, plumbing leaks, cleaning, ice machines Floor cleaning products                     Resulting from failure to follow appropriate cleaning protocol Body fluids                     Blood, vomit Condensation                     Variations in temperature Dusts                     Natural or from stored materials Debris                     Bags, paper, food residues, soil, cardboard boxes Uneven walking surfaces, holes, changes in level, broken or loose floor tiles, defective or wrinkled carpet or uneven steps thresholds. Mats or rugs not lying flat on the floor. Obstructions and accumulation of objects in walkways (e.g. hoses, cords, cables, debris, etc.). Unguarded platforms, walkways, and work areas 30 inches above ground. Inadequate illumination Higher Risk Areas  For purposes of this policy, an area where slip, trip, or fall hazards may likely arise during a typical work shift, is considered a    higher risk area   . Examples of higher risk areas include  Dining hall kitchens     wet floor Locker rooms     wet floor Loading docks     elevated locations Inspections Inspections to identify slip, trip and fall hazards are recommended at least annually.   For higher risk areas, a formal inspection is recommended at least quarterly  more frequently depending on the likelihood for changing conditions.   A sample inspection form is contained in Appendix A. Recommended inspections should minimally include evaluation of the following  Condition of floors, carpets, and steps Floor maintenance protocol Housekeeping practices Lighting levels Presence and condition of guardrails  handrails at elevated work surfaces. Hazard Control Measures General Housekeeping Procedures   Safe Work Practices The following housekeeping procedures and safe work practices must be followed to prevent accidents associated with slip, trip and fall hazards  General Safety Avoid running or walking too fast, especially in higher risk areas. Avoid carrying items that will obstruct one   s view of their walking pathway. Avoid walking through potential slip, trip and fall hazards. Use extra caution when traveling both outdoors and indoors during  following wet weather. General Housekeeping Procedures Clean up spills immediately. For greasy liquids, use suitable cleaning agent. Do not leave floors wet after cleaning     clean them to a completely dry finish if possible. If  clean-to-dry  is not possible, then use barriers and  wet floor  warning signs to keep people off the wet area. Use cleaning methods that do not spread the problem. Small spills are often better dealt with using a paper towel instead of a mop that wets a larger area of floor. Do not use cardboard to soak up spills. Slip Hazards Floors, platforms, and walkways shall be maintained in good repair, and reasonably free of oil, grease, or water. Mats, grates, or other methods that provide equivalent protection shall be used on areas where operation requires walking on slippery surfaces. Slip-resistant floor coatings should be used in areas that are likely to be wet or subject to frequent spills. Slip hazards must be identified and removed promptly. Warning signs or other equally effective means (barricades) should be used as a warning system in areas where a slip hazard is present. Trip Hazards Platforms and walkways shall be free of obstructions and dangerous projections (e.g. extension cords, power cables, hoses, carts, boxes, debris). Position equipment to avoid cables crossing pedestrian routes  use cable covers securely affixed to surfaces, or consider use of cordless tools. Surfaces in poor repair (i.e. holes, surface upheaval, and broken tiles) shall be repaired or guarded by readily visible barricades, rails or other equally effective means. Ensure floor mats and rugs lay flat and do not have curling edges. Floor Mats and Other Floor Treatments Where work processes are expected to create wet floor surfaces, such surfaces shall be protected against slipping by using mats, grates, cleats, or other methods that provide equivalent protection. Where wet processes take place, drainage shall be maintained and false floors, platforms, mats, or other dry standing places provided. Floor mats Floor mats shall be placed at building entrances and higher risk areas where walking-working surfaces may be wet. Examples of these areas include  Areas adjacent to food counters and food preparation areas Cooking areas Dishwashing areas Frying stations The design of floor mats should have the following features  Slip resistant surface on both top and bottom sides. Beveled edges, flat edges or similar design to help reduce the likelihood of workers tripping on the mat   s edges. Slots or similar design to help promote drainage and prevent accumulation of water & grease. Antibacterial treatment or similar design to help prevent the growth of mold and mildew. Floor mats should not be installed and used in a way where the mat itself becomes a slip or trip hazard. Other Treatments  Other floor treatments may be used to reduce slip hazards associated with wet floors. Slip-Resistant Footwear Employees who work in potentially slippery higher risk areas should consider slip-resistant footwear. When selecting slip-resistant footwear, the following should be considered  Level of slip-resistance (i.e. Polyurethane and microcellular urethane soles are more slip-resistant compared to nitrite and styrene rubber). Tread design, tread hardness, and shape of sole and heel. (i.e.   High elastic soles with raised-tread and cross-hatch patterns are more slip-resistant compared to rough and flat soles. Tread patterns should cover the whole sole and heel area.) Proper support and comfort. NOTE  The use of slip-resistant footwear alone is not adequate in preventing slip-related accidents. General housekeeping procedures, safe work practices, and matting  floor treatments (as necessary) must be used. Floor Maintenance Procedures A floor maintenance procedure must exist where routine or occasional floor cleaning is performed by departmental staff.   Consulting with floor cleaner product manufacturer for guidance on suggested cleaning procedures is recommended.   The following should be considered when developing a floor maintenance procedure  The type of floor finish products used, including slip-resistant polymer finishes, strippers, degreasers and general cleaners. Proper application methods for products, including proper dilution and time schedules for each component or process. Proper warning system used during floor maintenance operation to alert building occupants of the presence of potential slip, trip and fall hazards. Documentation of products used, including Safety Data Sheets, and specifications regarding the slip-resistance level of the product. Periodic review of maintenance program, especially after a report of an employee    near miss    or actual accident. Training For employees working in higher risk areas, training should be provided to ensure employees are in compliance with safe work practices. Department-specific training may be arranged upon request by contacting EHS at 974-5084. All employees who may be required to work in a higher risk area should be trained on the following  Recognition of potential hazards associated with working in a higher risk area. The use of control measures to prevent slip, trip and fall related accidents. The frequency of training provided to the employees is to be determined by the supervisor and EHS. Recordkeeping EHS shall maintain the following record related to falls Accident reports and investigations (minimum five years) based on OSHA requirements Inspection reports, which include information on slip, trip and fall hazards for at least five years Complaints involving fall hazards for at least five years References ANSI - various OSHA 29 CFR 1910 (General Industry)     Various sections OSHA 29 CFR 1926 (Construction)    Various sections EHS Safety Manual - Ladder Safety (GS-045) Stanford University Slip, Trip and Fall Prevention Guide Disclaimer The information provided in these guidelines is designed for educational use only and is not a substitute for specific training or experience.

Ladders with structural defects, such as  broken or missing rungs, cleats, or steps, etc. shall be marked defective or tagged with    Do Not Use    and withdrawn from service until repaired. OSHA Rules for ALL Ladders Maintain ladders free of oil, grease, and other slipping hazards. Do not load ladders beyond their maximum intended load nor beyond their manufacturer   s rated capacity. Use ladders only for their designated purpose. Use ladders only on stable and level surfaces unless secured to prevent accidental movement. Do not use ladders on slippery surfaces unless secured or provided with slip-resistant feet to prevent accidental movement. Do not use slip resistant feet as a substitute for exercising care when placing, lashing, or holding a ladder upon slippery surfaces. Keep areas clear around the top and bottom of ladders. Do not move, shift, or extend ladders while in use. Use ladders equipped with nonconductive side rails if the worker or the ladder could contact exposed energized electrical equipment. Face the ladder when moving up or down. Use at least one hand to grasp the ladder when climbing. Do not carry objects or loads that could cause loss of balance and falling. Secure ladders placed in areas, such as hallways and doorways, or where they can be displaced by workplace activities or traffic to prevent accidental movement. OSHA Portable Ladder Safety According to OSHA, falls from portable ladders are one of the leading causes of occupational injury. Below are general rules to follow when using portable ladders  Read and follow all manufacturer   s labels and markings on the ladder. Avoid electrical hazards. Look for overhead power lines before handling a ladder. Avoid using a metal ladder near power lines or exposed energized electrical equipment. Always inspect the ladder prior to using it. If the ladder is damaged, it must be removed from service and tagged until repaired or discarded. Always maintain a 3-point contact on the ladder when climbing. Keep your body near the middle of the step and always face the ladder when climbing. Only use ladders and accessories for their designated purposes. Ladders must be free of any slippery material on the rungs, steps or feet. Do not use a self-supporting ladder (i.e. step ladder) as a single ladder or in a partially closed position. Do not use the top step rung of a ladder as a step rung unless it was designated for that purpose. Use a ladder only on a stable and level surface, unless it has been secured (top or bottom) to prevent displacement. Do not place ladder on boxes, barrels or other unstable bases to obtain additional height. Do not move or shift a ladder while a person or equipment is on the ladder. An extension or straight ladder used to access an elevated surface must extend at least 3 feet above the point of support. Do not stand on the three top rungs of a straight, single, or extension ladder. The proper angle for setting up a ladder is to place its base a quarter of the working length of the ladder from the wall or other vertical surface. A ladder placed in any location where it can be displaced by other work activities must be secured to prevent displacement, or a barricade must be erected. Be sure that all locks on an extension ladder are properly engaged. Do not exceed the maximum load rating of a ladder. Training Under the provisions of the OSHA standard 1926.1060(a), employers must provide a training program for each employee using ladders for construction activities. The program must enable each employee to recognize hazards related to ladders and to use proper procedures to minimize these hazards. For example, employers must ensure that each employee is trained by a competent person in the following areas, as applicable  The nature of fall hazards in the work area  The correct procedures for erecting, maintaining, and disassembling the fall protection systems to be used  The proper construction, use, placement, and care in handling of all ladders  and The maximum intended load-carrying capacities of ladders used. In addition, retraining must be provided for each employee, as necessary, so that the employee maintains the understanding and knowledge acquired through compliance with the standard. Recordkeeping An individual training record shall be maintained for each employee and kept for period of employment + 5 years. The training instructor will document certify the training and evaluation and will include in the documentation the name of the operator, the date of the training, the date of the evaluation, and the identity of the person(s) performing the training or evaluation.

Machine guards can be purchased from the manufacturer or fabricated. Always check with the manufacturer of the machine to see if they also produce safeguards for that particular machine before fabricating a guard. Guards designed and installed by the builder manufacture offer two main advantages  They usually conform to the design and function of the machine. They can be designed to strengthen the machine in some way or to serve some additional functional purposes. Employees often work with job specific types of machines long enough that it becomes second nature to operate the machine. This can become potentially hazardous since  Continuous repetition can lead to a lack of concentration when operating the machine. The operator believes that they are skillful enough with the piece of equipment that the machine guard is not needed and they proceed to remove the guard. A dangerous situation is created in both of these scenarios for the operator and employees that may be working around the machine during the time of operation. Never take for granted the security of working with the same machine. Remember to always be alert and conscious of all moving machine parts no matter how simple the operation of the machine may be. Hazardous activities are considered to be situations that may present a potential hazard to the operator or employees working around the machine during operation. Examples of hazardous activities while operating any machine includes  Normal production operations Set-up threading preparation Inspection Clearing jams Adjustments Cleaning Lubricating Maintenance Do not wear loose clothing or jewelry, the material may become entangled or caught in the machine. Once caught, these items can cause the employee to become entangled in or pulled into the machine. A machine consists of three basic mechanical components  Point of Operation  Where work is performed on the material. Points of operation must be machine guarded. (i.e. - Cutting, forming, etc.) Power Transmission Devices  This is the mechanical component that transmits energy to the part of the machine that performs the work. (e.g. flywheels, pulleys, belts, connecting rods, etc.) Operating Controls (Other Moving Parts)  Are all of the parts on a machine that move while the machine is operating. (i.e. - Reciprocating, rotating, etc.) **Note  Even though machines have these three basic components, this does not mean that every machine has the same machine guarding. There are 4 types of hazardous motions that are associated with machines  Rotating Motion is a circular motion that is generated from a variety of mechanisms on machines Rotating parts on a machine can    grab    an employee through minor contact which can force the hand, arm, or any other body part into a dangerous position. The danger increases when projections such as set screws, bolts, nicks, abrasions, and projecting keys are exposed on rotating parts.   The danger also increases if loose clothing is being worn or if an employee has long hair.   Collars, couplings, cams, clutches, flywheels, shaft ends, spindles, meshing gears, and horizontal or vertical shafting are some examples of common rotating mechanisms which may be hazardous. Reciprocating Motions is a back-and-forth or up and-down motion that can strike or pin an employee between a moving part and a fixed object. Transverse motion  This refers to movement in a straight and continuous line. This type of motion creates a hazard because a worker may be struck or caught in a pinch or shear point by the moving part. An excellent example of a transverse motion would be a conveyor belt or belt sander. In-Running Nip Points  Pinch points develop when two parts move together and at least one moves in a circular motion. In-running nip points occur when machine parts move toward each other or when one part moves past a stationary object.   (ex. Gears, rollers, belt drives, and pulleys) The 4 types of hazardous actions that are associated with machines are  Cutting Action  May involve rotating, reciprocating, or transverse motion. The danger of cutting action exists at the point of operation where finger, arm, and body injuries can occur, and where flying chips or scrap material can strike the head, face, and eyes.   Hazards are present at the point of operation when cutting wood, metal, or other materials.   Several examples of mechanisms involving cutting hazards include band saws, circular saws, boring and drilling machines, turning machines (lathes), and milling machines. Punching Action  Results when power is applied to a slide (ram) for the purpose of blanking, drawing, or stamping metal or other types of materials. The danger of this type of action occurs at the point of operation where stock is inserted, held, and withdrawn by the employee. Examples of machines used for punching operations are power presses and iron workers. Shearing  Action happens when power is applied to a slide or knife that is used to trim or shear metal or other materials. The hazard occurs at the point where the employee inserts, holds, or withdraws the stock by hand. Examples of machines used for shearing operations are mechanically, hydraulically, or pneumatically powered shears. Bending Action  occurs when power is applied to a slide in order to draw, turn, or stamp metal or other materials into a specified shape. A hazard occurs at the point of operation where stock is inserted, held, and withdrawn.   Equipment that uses bending action includes power presses, press brakes, and tube benders. Guarding should  Protect the operator and other employees in the machine area from hazards such as those created by the point of operation, ingoing nip points, rotating parts, flying chips, and sparks. Be attached to the machine or secured elsewhere if attachment is not possible. Not pose an accident hazard in itself. Conform to applicable government and industry standards. In the absence of such standards, it must be designed and constructed to prevent the operator and other employees from having any body part in the danger zone during the machine   s operating cycle. Be secured by means not easily removed. Facilitate machine inspection as practical Permit maximum visibility of the point of operation Allow for safe lubrication Protect from falling objects. The guard must ensure that no objects fall on moving parts. Below is a table illustrating the OSHA Maximum Permissible Openings for Guards  Distance of Opening from Point of Operation (inches) Maximum Width of Openings (inches)    to 1       1    to 2        2    to 3       3    to 5        5    to 6       6    to 7        7    to 12    1    12    to 15    1    15    to 17    1     17    to 31    2     Over 31    6 General machine guarding policies are as follows  A guard shall be attached to each machine, if possible, and be designed so it does not offer an accident hazard. A guard device shall prevent the operator from having any part of the body from contacting the moving parts of machinery or equipment during the operating cycle. Special hand tools provide supplemental protection for employees when placing and removing material. They permit easy handling of materials and eliminate the need for operators to place a hand in the danger zone. Such tools do not replace guarding. All revolving drums, barrels and containers shall be guarded by an enclosure that is interlocked with the drive mechanism. All revolving shafts, wheels, pulleys and other revolving parts shall be guarded to prevent an employee from coming in contact with the moving part. If the periphery of blades of a fan is less than seven feet above the floor or working level, the blades shall be guarded. The guard shall have openings that are no larger than    inch. Machines designed for a fixed location shall be securely anchored to prevent walking, moving, and tipping. All MPTE and MH shall be adequately guarded to prevent accidental contact. Guards provided by the factory shall be used where possible. Where guards are not available from the equipment manufacturer, they shall be fashioned with material of suitable strength, durability and in accordance with ANSI standards Guarding may be omitted where MH and MPTE hazards are not accessible. Loose clothing or jewelry should not be worn, because the material may become entangled or caught in the machine. Power transmission equipment whose location is not readily apparent, but could be accessed by any part of the human body shall be guarded. Where it is infeasible to guard an MH or MPTE conspicuously displayed signs shall be posted. Inspection  Employees who are assigned to machine operations or maintenance shall inspect machines before working with them. Machinery Maintenance and Repair A preventative maintenance program shall be implemented to maintain the reliability of the machines and their guards.   The manufacturer should be consulted to develop to frequency and method of preventative maintenance. Machine design should permit lubrication and adjustment without removal of guards. If machine guards must be removed, the maintenance and repair crew must always replace them prior to re-energization. Maintenance work shall not be performed until the machine is disconnected and locked out, consistent with UT   s Lockout Tagout policy and OSHA regulatory requirements. All woodworking machines will be maintained in good condition. This includes replacing dull blades, cutting heads, and damaged or unserviceable parts. Equipment blade changes or adjustments will be performed only when the power source has been disconnected to comply with the lockout tagout standard. Equipment in which guards cannot be installed shall be removed from service. This includes older equipment which never had factory-installed guards. All bearings will be lubricated and any debris removed from their surface to prevent fires. All adjustments will be made by an employee who is trained and knowledgeable about the particular piece of equipment being adjusted. Power-transmission apparatus (shafting, flywheels, pulleys, belts, chain drives, etc.) less than 7 feet from the floor or working platform must be guarded. For grinders, work rests on offhand grinding machines must be kept adjusted closely to the wheel with a maximum opening of 1 8-inch to prevent the work from being jammed between the wheel and the rest, which may result in wheel breakage. The distance between the wheel periphery and the adjustable tongue must never exceed 1 4-inch.   Immediately before mounting, all wheels shall be closely inspected and sounded by the user (ring test) to make sure they have not been damaged in transit, storage, or otherwise. The spindle speed of the machine shall be checked before mounting of the wheel to be certain that it does not exceed the maximum operating speed marked on the wheel. Wheels should be tapped gently with a light nonmetallic implement, such as the handle of a screwdriver for light wheels, or a wooden mallet for heavier wheels. If they sound cracked (dead), they shall not be used. This is known as the  Ring Test . Good Housekeeping is important to minimize injuries when performing maintenance work on machines and when using machines. Remove slip, trip and fall hazards from areas around machines Use drip pans when oiling equipment Remove waste material as it is generated Make work area large enough for machine operation and maintenance Place machines away from high traffic areas to reduce worker distraction Training Training will be required on the proper use of guards before employees and students are allowed to use equipment. The supervisor should maintain a list of all employees and students authorized to use the specific machine. Training should include the following elements  Ensure understanding of  proper operation, safety procedures, hazard recognition and emergency shutdown procedures for each machine they are assigned to operate. Identify multiple energy sources and explain machine-specific lockout and tagout procedures to all personnel assigned to work on the machine. Identify personal protective equipment required and demonstrate how to properly wear the PPE Recordkeeping Training records and self-inspection checklists should be documented will be maintained by the supervisor or Principal Investigator.   EHS will maintain inspection records of areas on campus where machines are inspected.

Effective Date  04 22 1998 Revision Date  02 01 2014 jump to appendices and forms   highlight  Purpose It shall be the policy of the University of Tennessee to following accepted standards and regulations to protect the health and well-being of its employees and students. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration   s (OSHA) Control of Hazardous Energy (also known as lockout tagout) shall be implemented and followed by affected individuals. Scope and Applicability Although the OSHA standard applies to employees, this program was written to include students and visitors to the University where feasible. Contractors are covered by this program when working with UT students or employees and while working on UT-owned equipment that could impact the safety of the students or UT employees. Accidents and injuries associated with unexpected equipment start up during maintenance and repair activities can be serious. Amputations, electrocutions and fatalities can occur due to failure to follow accepted lockout tagout procedures. The following written plan was developed to provide general information and guidance for those departments on campus who have employees covered by the OSHA Lockout Tagout standard (29 CFR 1910.147). This program also serves as a supplement to required training.   Departments with employees that work on UT owned equipment must have specific lockout tagout procedures. Abbreviations and Definitions Definitions Affected employee  A person who uses equipment that is being serviced under lockout or tagout procedures or who works in an area where equipment is being serviced. Authorized employee  A person who locks out or tags out equipment to do service or maintenance work. An affected employee becomes an authorized employee when that employee   s duties include service or maintenance work on equipment. Capable of being locked out  An energy-isolating device that is designed with a hasp or other means of attachment to which, or through which a lock can be affixed, or if it has a locking mechanism built into it. Other energy-isolating devices will also be considered to be capable of being locked out, if lock out can be achieved without the need to dismantle, rebuild, or replace the energy- isolating device or permanently alter its energy-control capability. Disconnect  A switch that disconnects an electrical circuit or load (motor, transformer, or panel) from the conductors that supply power to it. An open circuit does not allow electrical current to flow. Under a lockout procedure, a disconnect must be capable of being locked in the open position. Energized  Connected to an energy source or containing potential energy. Energy source  Any source of energy. Examples  electrical, mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic, chemical, and thermal. Energy-isolating device (EID)  A mechanical device that physically prevents transmission or release of energy. Hazardous energy  Any of the types of energy existing at a level or quantity that could be harmful to workers or cause injury through inadvertent release or start-up of equipment. Lockout device  A device that locks an energy-isolating device in the safe position. Lockout  Placing a lockout device on an energy-isolating device, under an established procedure, to ensure the energy-isolating device and the equipment it controls can   t be operated until the lockout device is removed. (An energy-isolating device is capable of being locked out if it has a hasp that accepts a lock or if it has a locking mechanism built into it.) Procedure  A series of steps taken to isolate energy and shut down equipment. Servicing or maintenance  Workplace activities such as constructing, installing, setting up, adjusting, inspecting, modifying, and maintaining machines or equipment. Also includes lubricating, cleaning, unjamming, and making adjustments or tool changes if a worker may be exposed to the unexpected startup of the equipment during such activities. Roles and Responsibilities EHS shall  Serve as a technical resource for questions and comments for the lockout tagout program and periodically review compliance with this program. Post the most recent edition of this policy on the EHS website. Review and revise this policy periodically and upon notice of the need for changes. Maintain records as required. Provide general training on lockout tagout safety upon request. Supervisors shall  Enforce the use of lockout and tagout devices when employees do service or maintenance work and may be exposed to hazardous energy Notify affected employees of lockout tag-out procedures that are going to take place in their work area. Develop and maintain safe shut down procedures on each piece of equipment or machine that their employees are expected to service or maintain. Ensure that employees are properly trained on the use of lockout tagout devices. Maintain written procedures developed for equipment containing more than one energy source. Maintain training and audit records. Ensure employees have the proper lockout tagout equipment. Ensure that specific policies and procedures concerning lockout tagout safety practices are in place. Ensure authorized individuals are audited annually on lockout tagout. Authorized Individuals shall  Follow the lockout tagout procedures described in this policy and the department   s specific policy. Notify their supervisor when they have any questions about isolating energy sources safely  have observed on-compliance activities or when problems are identified with equipment or lockout devices. Comply with the UT lockout tagout policy and the specific shut down procedures Perform audits on lockout tagout, but does not use lockout tagout on the equipment that is being audited. Participate in training on the purpose and use of energy-control procedures. Affected Employees (non-authorized employees) shall  Participate in awareness training concerning the procedures and the prohibition against starting machines that are locked or tagged out. Contractors and Subcontractors shall  Comply with all provisions of UT   s Lockout Tagout Policy. Ensure that his or her employees are appropriately trained and authorized. Comply with any shut down procedures that have been developed by the University for each Machine or piece of equipment that the contractor must service or maintain or other such project where energy sources are present. When shut down procedures are not available from the University, the contractor shall develop and provide the University with their own shut down procedures for that machine or piece of equipment or project. Procedures A specific procedure must be developed for equipment containing more than one energy source. Each department is encouraged to develop these written procedures. A copy of the procedure should be kept in the department s file and ideally a copy posted at the equipment. The Lockout Tagout Procedure (Appendix A) provides a good template for procedure development. Environmental Health and Safety is available to assist in the development of written procedures. Procedures shall clearly outline the scope, purpose, authorization, rules and techniques to be used. If an error or omission is detected in a specific written procedure, it is the responsibility of the authorized individual who identifies the error or omission to bring it to the attention of his or her supervisor. Corrections must then be made and communicated to each authorized individual who works with this procedure. Hot Tap Work Hot taps involve working on equipment while it is energized. Hot tap work is discouraged and should only be done where it is infeasible to do otherwise and must be done by knowledgeable authorized individuals. Where hot tap work is conducted, additional precautions must be taken and specific written procedures must be developed. Authorized individuals performing hot tap work must be trained in these procedures. Signs and Warnings Signs must be placed on all equipment requiring lockout tagout at the energy isolation device. Lockout and tagout devices  Lockout and tagout devices must meet the following criteria to ensure that they are effective and not removed inadvertently  Lockout devices must work under the environmental conditions in which they are used. Locks shall only be used for lockout purposed and shall be    heavy-duty   . Heavy-duty is defined as a lock that can be removed only with heavy-duty bolt cutters Tagout device warnings must remain legible even when they are used in wet, damp, or corrosive conditions. Tags shall be held in place with a tie capable of withstanding 50 lbs. of force. At least one tag must be provided for locations where locks are applied. Note that if more than one energy isolation device (EID) is locked out, there must be a tag at each EID. Lockout and tagout devices must be designated by color, shape, or size. The locks and tags used for lockout shall be standardized within each department. An authorized individual should never lend their lock or key to anyone else. Tagout devices must have a standardized print and warning format. Lockout devices and tagout devices must be strong enough that they can   t be removed inadvertently. Tagout devices must be attached with a single-use, self-locking material such as a nylon cable tie. Any employee who sees a lockout or tagout device must be able to recognize who attached it and its purpose. Each lock must have a unique key or combination. An authorized individual should never lend their lock or key to anyone else. There may be situations where several locks are necessary for a lockout. A department may elect to have several locks that can be used as a unit. However, control must be maintained over the keys. Energy-isolating devices are the primary means for protecting UT employees who service equipment and must be designed to accept a lockout device. Energy isolating devices must clearly identify function Electrical energy sources Lockout or tagout of electrical energy sources must occur at the circuit disconnect switch. Electrical control circuitry does not effectively isolate hazardous energy. See also, Alternative methods. Lock Removal Locks and or tags must not be removed by anyone other than the authorized individual who installed it. There is one exception to this rule. The authorized individual s supervisor may remove his or her lock, but only when it is absolutely necessary to remove the lockout tagout. If the lock and or tag are removed, every effort must be made to notify the authorized individual that his or her lock has been removed. Efforts to be made to notify the authorized individual that their lock has been removed include  Verification that the authorized employee who applied the device is not on site  Making all reasonable efforts to contact the authorized employee to inform him her that his her lockout or tagout device has been removed  and Ensuring that the authorized employee has this knowledge before he she resumes work on the site. Equipment for lockout tagout The following is a list of equipment that may be used in lockout. An adequate supply of each required item must be available for the authorized individual. Lock and key Tags and ties Multiple lock hasp Lock box (if used in the department) Breaker locks Fuse pullers Insulated mats Hot sticks Chains Electrical meter to determine the status of an electric circuit Valve covers Blocks Blanks Jacks Supports (posts, columns, timbers, etc.) Other items as necessary Lockout Tagout Auditing  The OSHA standard requires that each authorized employee be audited annually on lockout tagout. The audit must be conducted by an authorized individual who is authorized to perform a lockout tagout, but does not use lockout tagout on the equipment that is being audited. To assist departments in auditing, an audit checklist has been developed (see Appendix B). This form, or a similar record, should be maintained in the department s files. Off-Site Safety  Each department head is responsible for identifying lockout tagout activities affecting their employees and students while engaged in University-sponsored activities away from the main campus. Provisions shall be made to assure that these individuals are not exposed to hazards posed by activities requiring lockout tagout. Exposure survey  Authorized Individuals will conduct a hazardous-energy survey to determine affected machines and equipment, types and magnitude of energy, and necessary service and maintenance tasks. Each task will be evaluated to determine if it must be accomplished with lockout or tagout procedures. Energy control procedures  Authorized employees who lockout or tagout equipment or do service and maintenance must follow specific written energy-control procedures. The procedures must include the following information  The intended use of the procedure Steps for shutting down, isolating, blocking, and securing equipment Steps for placing, removing, and transferring lockout devices Equipment-testing requirements to verify the effectiveness of the energy-control procedures These procedures are required when re-energizing equipment is necessary and when power is needed to test or position the equipment (for example, temporary removal of lockout or tagout devices is allowed. This applies only for the time required to perform the task and the procedure must be documented. Employees must do the following before they begin service or maintenance work  Inform all affected employees of equipment shutdown. Shut down equipment. Isolate or block hazardous energy. Remove any potential (stored) energy. Lockout or tagout the energy sources. Verify the equipment is isolated from hazardous energy and de-energized. Employees   must   do   the following   they   remove   lockout   or   tagout   devices   and   re-energize equipment  Remove tools and replace machine or equipment components. Inform coworkers about energy-control device removal. Ensure all workers are clear of the work area. Verify machine or equipment power controls are off or in a neutral position. Remove the lockout or tagout device. Re-energize equipment. Specific energy-control procedures Departments have developed specific energy-isolation procedures for all machines and equipment that have energy-isolating devices Special lockout tagout situations Energized testing  When an energy-isolating device is locked or tagged and it is necessary to test or position equipment, do the following  Remove unnecessary tools and materials. Ensure that all other employees are out of the area. Remove locks or tags from energy isolating devices. Proceed with test. De-energize equipment and lockout or tagout energy-isolating devices. Operate equipment controls to verify that the equipment is de-energized. Contract service and maintenance The OSHA standard requires that contractors be made aware of specific lockout tagout procedures. Note this applies to  specific  procedures and not the general procedure found in Appendix A. Both UT employees and contractors must be aware of their respective lockout tagout procedures before the contractor does onsite work. UT employees must understand and comply with the contractor   s energy-control procedures. Group lockout When authorized employees must service equipment that has several energy sources and several energy-isolating devices, the employees must follow specific group lockout procedures. Shift changes and long-term shutdowns Employees must follow the department   s specific written procedures when it is necessary to continue lockout tagout when work shifts change and during long-term shutdowns. Supervisors are responsible for monitoring lockout and tagout devices that control the energy to equipment during long-term shutdowns Alternative methods When lockout or tagout is not used for tasks that are routine, repetitive, and integral to the production process, or prohibits the completion of those tasks, then an alternative method must be used to control hazardous energy. Selection of an alternative control method must be based on a risk assessment of the machine, equipment, or process. The risk assessment must consider existing safeguards provided with the machine, equipment or process that may need to be removed or modified to perform a given task. For example, when control circuits are used as part of the safeguarding system, the system must be designed to ensure protection as effective as a mechanical disconnect switch or master shut-off valve. A control-reliable dual channel hardwired circuit of industrially-rated components that satisfies the design features as specified in ANSI B11.19, with a safety relay or safety PLC to ensure integrity and performance of the safeguarding system, must be used. Under all circumstances, the individual must have exclusive personal control over the means to maintain the state of the control circuit in a protective mode. Inspections of written energy-control procedures Authorized Employees or Supervisors will perform and document annual inspections of energy- control procedures to ensure that employees understand and use them effectively. Documentation will include the following  The equipment on which the procedure is used. The date of the inspection. The employees included in the inspection. The inspector. If an inspector finds that employees are not following an energy-control procedure or that the procedure is not protecting them, employees must be retrained and the procedure   s deficiencies corrected. The inspector must understand the procedure and must be someone other than those following the procedure at the time of the inspection. Each procedure   s accuracy, completeness, and effectiveness must be verified. If the inspection covers a procedure for equipment with an energy-isolating device that can be locked out, the inspector must review the procedure with the employees who use it to service the equipment. The inspector can review the procedure with the employees individually or in a group. If the inspection covers a procedure for equipment with an energy-isolating device that can only be tagged out, the inspector must review the procedure with the authorized employees who service the equipment and with affected employees who may work in the area when the equipment is serviced. The inspector can review the procedure with the employees individually or in a group. See Appendix B for a sample Annual Employee Audit form. Training Employees who may be exposed to hazardous energy will receive training before assignment to ensure that they understand UT   s energy-control policy and the department specific policy, and have skills to apply, use, and remove energy controls. The training will include the requirements of 1910.147 and the following  Affected employees will be trained in the purpose and use of energy-control procedures. An affected employee uses equipment that is being serviced under lockout or tagout procedures or works in an area where equipment is being serviced. Authorized employees will be trained to recognize hazardous energy sources, the type and magnitude of energy in the workplace, the methods and means necessary for isolating and controlling energy, and the means to verify that the energy is controlled. An authorized employee locks out or tags out equipment to do service work. An affected employee becomes an authorized employee when that employee   s duties include service or maintenance work on equipment. Employees whose jobs are in areas where energy-control procedures are used will be trained about the procedures and the prohibition against starting machines that are locked or tagged out. Employees will be retrained annually to ensure they understand energy-control policy and procedures. Authorized and affected employees will be retrained whenever their job assignments change, energy-control procedures change, equipment or work processes present new hazards, or when they don   t follow energy-control procedures. Current training records will be maintained for each authorized and affected employee including the employee   s name and the training date. A sample form documenting training certification is found in Appendix C. Authorized individuals shall be trained in lockout tagout procedures. Training shall be provided to the following individuals  New employees  Employees who have transferred into the department  Employees who demonstrate a lack of knowledge in the lockout tagout procedure  When new equipment is introduced, or when a specific procedure is developed or modified  and Periodic refresher - recommended annually. Sources of Training  Programs (traditional classroom) are available upon request by Environmental Health & Safety. SkillSoft provided via K@TE Certification - A multiple question test. Successful completion of this test (minimum score 70%) documents the level of knowledge of the employee. Other approved sources. The above listed sources of training are generic in nature and provide an excellent base for knowledge for the authorized individual. However, complex equipment, with more than one source of energy, requires a specific written procedure. Individuals performing work on complex equipment should be trained on the procedures for that equipment. Recordkeeping Training must be documented. Each department must maintain a record of the training. The following information should be contained in the training record  date of training, instructor, name of employee and location and a brief description or outline of what was covered. Provisions shall be made for individuals who have limited reading skills to ensure they are familiar with the necessary information. A test is suggested at the end of each training program to demonstrate that the participants have the requisite knowledge.

Purpose To establish a program for safe entry into permit-required confined spaces at the UT Knoxville campus. This program establishes the controls and responsibilities for entering, working in, and exiting permit-required and non-permit required confined spaces in both general industry settings and in construction environments. Scope and Applicability This shall apply to all students, staff and faculty on the UT Knoxville campus who enter and work in any permit-required and non-permit required confined space. This covers all employees who enter a confined space on campus, such as ducts, tanks, manholes, etc, which may potentially contain hazardous atmospheres or conditions. If employees are engaged in both construction and general industry work in confined spaces the requirements of 29 CFR 1926 Subpart AA-Confined Spaces in Construction, must be followed. Abbreviations and Definitions Abbreviations ACGIH  American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists CRST  Confined Space Rescue Team LEL  Lower Explosive Limit PEL  Permissible Exposure Limit SDS  Safety Data Sheet TLV  Threshold Limit Value OSHA  Occupational Safety and Health Administration UEL  Upper Explosive Limit Definitions Authorized Entrants  Individuals who enter the permit-required confined space to perform work. Authorized Attendants  Individuals stationed outside one or more confined spaces who monitor the authorized entrants. Barrier  A physical obstruction that blocks or limits access. Confined Space  An area which  has a size and shape large enough for a person to enter  has limited entrances and exits  is not designed for continuous occupancy. Some examples of confined spaces include  storage tanks  evacuations trenches  boilers  elevator pits  exhaust ducts  sewers  large pipes  dust collectors  utility pits chases. Confined spaces are classified as either permit-required or non-permit required. Competent person  A person who is capable of identifying existing and predictable hazards in the surroundings or working conditions which are unsanitary, hazardous, or dangerous to employees, and who has the authorization to take prompt corrective measures to eliminate them. Control  means the action taken to reduce the level of any hazard inside a confined space using engineering methods (for example, by ventilation) and then using these methods to maintain the reduced hazard level.   Control also refers to the engineering methods used for this purpose.   Personal protective equipment (PPE) is not a control. Controlling contractor  is the employer who has overall responsibility for construction at the worksite.   Note  If the controlling contractor owns or manages the property, then it is both the controlling contractor and the host employer. Entry  The action by which a person passes through an opening into a permit- required confined Space. Entry includes ensuing work activities in that space and is considered to have occurred as soon as any part of the entrant   s body breaks the plane of an opening into the space. Entry employer  means any employer who decides that the employees it directs will enter a permit space.   Note  An employer cannot avoid the duties of the standard merely by refusing to decide whether its employees will enter a permit space, and OSHA will consider the failure to decide to be an implicit decision to allow employees to enter those spaces if they are working in the proximity of the space. Entry Permit  A written authorization to enter a permit-required confined space. It defines the conditions under which the permit space may be entered. It states the reasons for entering, identifies all hazardous and identifies the entry supervisor. Hazardous Atmosphere  At atmosphere that may expose employees to the risk of death, is toxic, is flammable or explosive, can results in incapacitation, interfere with an individual   s ability to escape unaided from a space, or cause acute illness. Host employer  means the employer who owns or manages the property where the construction work is taking place. Note  If the owner of the property on which the construction activity occurs has contracted with an entity for the general management of that property, and has transferred to that entity the information regarding 1) the location(s) of each known permit space  2) the hazards or potential hazards in each space or the reason it is a permit space  and 3) any precautions that the host employer or any previous controlling contractor or entry employer implemented for the protection of employees in the permit space, OSHA will the contracted management entity as the host employer for as long as that entity manages the property. Otherwise, OSHA will treat the owner of the property as the host employer.   In no case will there be more than one host employer. Isolation  The process by which a permit space is removed from service and completely protected against the release of hazardous energy and material into the space by such means as  blanking or blinding, misaligning or removing sections of lines, pipes, or ducts  a double block and bleed system  lockout tagout of all sources of energy  or blocking or disconnecting all mechanical linkage. Permit-Required Confined Space  According to the OSHA standard, this is a confined space and could potentially have one or more of the following hazards  Atmospheric Hazards  which can be asphyxiating, toxic, flammable, explosive, or oxygen-enriched. Engulfment Hazards  which occur when there is the potential to be trapped or enveloped by a dry, bulk granular material such as grains, soil or powdered cement. Configuration Hazards  in which the size or shape of the space can trap an individual or make escape or rescue difficult. Energy Hazards  which can happen if there is contact with electrical equipment, steam or other sources of energy inside the space. Non-permit required confined spaces  Confined spaces that do not have, or     have the potential to, contain any hazard or hazardous atmosphere capable of causing death or serious physical harm. Qualified person  means one who, by possession of a recognized degree, certificate, or professional standing, or who by extensive knowledge, training, and experience, has successfully demonstrated his ability to solve or resolve problems relating to the subject matter, the work, or the project. Roles and Responsibilities Program Managers (Directors) shall  Verify the purpose for each entry into a confined space and issue permits to protect entrants assigned to perform work. Ensure that all assigned entrants have current training in the procedures and precautions for work to be performed. Inform contractors of the confined space entry program requirements and of the potential hazards of each space to be entered. Understand all of the hazards associated with a particular permit-required confined space where work will be performed. Verify that rescue services are available and there is a means available to summon them. Prohibit any unauthorized individuals from entering the permit-required confined space. Ensure that entry operations are maintained consistent with the permit. Terminate entry and cancel the permit once work is completed. Controlling Contractors shall  Obtain information on the location of each permit space  the hazards or potential hazards of the spaces  and any precautions that the Host Employer, previous Controlling Contractor or previous Entry Employer implemented for the protection of employees in the permit space. Provide the information received from the Host Employer to each entity who is authorized to enter a permit space, or whose activities could foreseeably result in a hazard in the permit space. Provide any additional information or precautions specific to the Host Employer or Controlling Contractor regarding entry into permit spaces. Debrief each entity that entered a permit space regarding the permit space program that was followed and any hazards confronted or created in the permit space during entry operations. Appraise the Host Employer of any information obtained in its debriefing of entry employers. Entry Employers shall  Implement measures to prevent unauthorized entry into permit spaces. Identify and evaluate hazards of permit spaces before its employees enter them. Develop and implements the means, procedures and practices necessary for safe permit space entry operations. See 29 CFR 1926.1204(c)(1) through (c)(8) for list. Provide, maintain and assure the use of equipment required for safe entry at no cost to the entry employee. See 29 CFR 1926.1204(d)(1) through (d)(9) for list. Evaluate conditions inside the permit space and assure they are acceptable before authorizing entry. Provide at least one attendant outside the permit space into which entry is authorized for the duration of the entry. Designate each employee who will have an active role in entry operations, identify their duties and provide each with the necessary training required in 29 CFR 1926.1207. Develop and implement a system for summoning rescue and emergency services, for rescuing entrants from permit spaces, for providing necessary emergency services to rescued employees and from preventing unauthorized persons from attempting rescue. Develop and implement a system for the preparation, issuance, use and cancellation of entry permits including both planned and emergency termination as required by 29 CFR 1926.1205. Develop and implement procedures to coordinate entry operations in consultation with the Controlling Contractor so that the activities of one employer do not endanger the employees of another employer. Develop and implement a procedure for concluding entry operations. Review entry operations to identify and correct program deficiencies. Review the Permit Space program using cancelled permits that have been retained from the previous 12 month period. Entry Supervisors shall  Coordinate entry operations during a permit required confined space entry. Understands the hazards and possible consequences of the planned entry and verifies the permit, procedures and equipment are in place before the entry. Determine if a Non-Entry Retrieval system can be utilized during the entry. Supervise acceptable entry conditions when entry is planned. Authorize entry permit and oversee entry operations and for terminating entry as required by 29 CFR 1910.146. Confined Space Rescue Team shall  Have the capability to reach any victim(s) within an appropriate time frame for the hazards present Have the training and ability to administer rescue, first aid and CPR if needed. All other Employees shall  Have a general understanding or awareness of confined spaces and signage posted. Confined Space Authorized Entrants shall  Know the hazards that may be faced during entry, including information on how hazardous exposure may occur, and the signs, symptoms and severity of overexposure. Properly use any equipment needed to safely enter the space. Sign the confined space entry permit prior to entering the space Ensure that air monitoring has been conducted prior to entry and continuously throughout the work. Maintain communication with the attendant outside the space, following warnings given by the attendant and exiting the space immediately when told to do so. Alert the attendant whenever they recognize any warning sign or symptom of exposure to a dangerous situation, or the entrant detects a prohibited condition. Confined Space Authorized Attendants shall  Know the hazards associated with the confined space. Recognize symptoms and health effects if overexposure occurs. Order the entrants to evacuate the space if a new hazard or unusual behavior in the entrants is noted. Maintain an accurate count of the number of authorized entrants in the space. Remain outside the space during entry operations until relieved by another attendant. Maintain communications with authorized entrants to monitor their work activities and to alert them if evacuation becomes necessary. Call for rescue and other emergency services as soon as the attendant recognizes that the entrants may need assistance to escape from the space. Keep unauthorized persons from entering the space or interfering with the entry process. Initiate or perform non-entry rescues as outlined in the rescue plan. Perform no other activities, which may interfere with the primary job of monitoring the safety and condition of those people inside the confined space. EHS shall  Conduct evaluations of confined spaces on campus, classify and document each as either a permit-required confined space or non-permit required confined space. Review and revise the written confined space entry program periodically. Develop and conduct confined space training upon request. Verify that all entry equipment is maintained and or calibrated according to the manufacturer   s specifications and the preventive maintenance procedures. Offer advisement on the types of person protective equipment that will be required to enter the confined space. Program Activities Determining Type of Confined Space Before any confined space operations begin, the Entry Supervisor or Competent Person will determine if the confined space is permit-required. If there is uncertainty of whether the confined space is permitted, or not, please contact EHS for guidance.   If it is a permitted-required confined space, prior to beginning any confined space operations, the supervisor or project manager must develop procedures for the following  Summoning rescue and emergency services Rescuing entrants from permit spaces Providing necessary emergency services for rescue Preventing unauthorized personnel from attempting a rescue Only those individuals who have received confined space training can perform the work in the confined space. Permit A permit must be issued for approval before any work can take place in a confined space defined as permit-required. The entry supervisor must document safety measures being taken by completing a Confined Space Entry Permit. Before entry, the supervisor must sign the permit to authorize entry. The completed permit must be made available at the time of entry to all authorized entrants by posting it at the entry portal or by any other equally effective means  so that the entrants can confirm that pre-entry preparations have been completed. The duration of the permit may not exceed the time required to complete the assigned task or job identified on the permit. A Confined Space Entry Permit at UTK will contain the following information  The location of the permit space to be entered. The purpose of the entry. The date and the authorized duration of the entry permit. The name(s) of the authorized entrants working within the permit space. The employee(s), by name, currently serving as attendant(s). The employee, by name, currently serving as entry supervisor, with a space for the signature or initials of the entry supervisor who originally authorized entry. The hazards of the permit space to be entered. The measures used to isolate the permit space and to eliminate or control permit space hazards before entry. The rescue and emergency services that can be summoned and the means (such as the equipment to use and the numbers to call) for summoning those services. The communication procedures used by authorized entrants and attendants to maintain contact during the entry. Equipment, such as personal protective equipment, testing equipment, communications equipment, alarm systems, and rescue equipment, to be provided for compliance with this program. Any other information whose inclusion is necessary, given the circumstances of the particular confined space, to ensure employee safety. Any additional permits, such as for hot work, that have been issued to authorize work in the permit space. The permit will only cover one 8 hour shift. A new permit will need to be issued if confined space work will extend over one 8 hour shift period. When the work has been completed, the entrant will let the attendant know they are leaving the confined space. The attendant must visibly check and make sure all entrants have left the space and that no tools have been left behind. Pre-Job Preparations Before any confined space operations can take place, the following procedures must be followed  Isolate the permit space  Confined spaces that contain equipment or operations that through the activation of electricity, air, or hydraulics, may injure an employee or cause property damage must be isolated by lock-outs and tags or other positive means of preventing an accident. All involved employees must take part in the lockout tagout procedures. All electrical and mechanical systems must be tested prior to entry to ensure actual isolation of the systems. Purge, inert, flush, or ventilate the permit space as necessary to eliminate or control atmospheric hazards. Provide pedestrian, vehicle, or other barriers to prevent unauthorized entry and to prevent objects from falling onto entrants. This may include, but is not limited to, the following methods  set-up cones, post signs, partition-off the area with caution tape, erect barricades, and arrange for traffic control with the UT Police. All permit-required confined spaces will be marked with signs stating  DANGER FOLLOW CONFINED SPACE ENTRY PROCEDURE BEFORE ENTERING Here is an example of a permit-required confined space sign  (see image). Spaces not permanently marked (ex  manholes) shall be posted with a portable sign when access to the spaces are required. Confined Space operations involving entry into hot and cold environments may require use of appropriate protective clothing. Consult with EHS prior to selecting any form of personnel protective equipment (PPE), this may include  safety glasses, gloves, chemical resistant suits, hearing protection, etc. Equipment used in confined space work operations will only be issued to those employees who are trained in their use. This may include  Ventilating equipment needed to obtain acceptable entry conditions. Communications equipment necessary to enable the authorized entrant(s) and attendant maintain constant communication and to enable the attendant to summon rescue services without leaving his her post. Personal protective equipment when feasible engineering and work practice controls do not adequately protect employees. Lighting equipment needed to enable employees to see well enough to work safely and to exit the space quickly in an emergency. Barriers and shields Obtain equipment, such as ladders, harnesses and lifelines needed for safe ingress and egress by authorized entrants. Obtain rescue and emergency equipment except to the extent that the equipment is provided by or for rescue services. Obtain any other equipment necessary for safe entry into and rescue from permit spaces. Hazard testing before and during entry into confined space All confined spaces will be tested by a competent individual before and during entry, using properly calibrated and approved equipment, to evaluate any hazards in the confined space and to verify that the confined space is adequate for entry. The air in the confined space will be tested for oxygen levels, flammable gases and vapors, and toxic air contaminants and airborne combustible dusts, which are OSHA mandated. The oxygen levels must be between 19.5-23.5%. The initial air readings must be recorded on the permit and kept at the worksite for the duration of the job. If there is the possibility that conditions could change during the entry, continuous air monitoring will be maintained for oxygen, flammable gases and vapors, and toxic substances. If work is stopped for any reason, the air tests must be re-taken if deemed necessary by the Entry Supervisor, prior to re-entry. Eliminating hazards Mechanical ventilation will be provided when necessary. Follow these guidelines for ventilating confined spaces  Begin ventilation in time to assure that the space is safe before entry. Test the atmosphere before entry to confirm that the ventilation system is working properly and that the space is safe. Continuous ventilation must be maintained throughout the entry. If work inside the space can make the air unsafe (e.g., hot work, painting, using solvents, sandblasting, etc.) continue ventilation as long as the work is in progress. Protective equipment and respirators are to be used only when normal cleaning and ventilating procedures fail to reduce hazards to safe levels.   Rescue Caution  Confined space attendants shall not enter the confined space for rescue, unless they are qualified for such rescue and a qualified attendant is present to take their place. As soon as the attendant determines that the entrants may need assistance to escape from the permit space hazards, the attendant shall do the following in the order given  Immediately summon rescue services by calling the Knoxville Fire Department at 911 by cell phone, and identifying the site as accurately as possible. If possible, attempt a non-entry rescue while rescue emergency services are en route. Using lifeline mechanical retrieval device(s), extricate the entrant using care to prevent injury or entanglement of the entrant or lifeline within the space. A hoist or other mechanical device for personnel removal will be used for all spaces in excess of five (5) feet in depth. This equipment will be used in situations where it may be difficult to rescue the entrant. If extrication is successful, begin first aid (if trained) as required until relieved by rescuers. Upon their arrival, inform rescuers of any known hazards within the space and make available any material safety data sheets pertinent to the rescue. Rescue and Emergency Services The primary method of rescue services is provided in-house however  further outside rescue and emergency services may be identified as backup permit space rescue. Rescuers must be able to respond to a rescue summons in a    timely manner    based on the potential hazards of the space. UT is using the City of Knoxville   s Confined Space Rescue team to perform rescue operations on campus.   UT Knoxville is using the City of Knoxville Fire Department for rescue services and the Knoxville Volunteer Rescue Squad for backup services. The non-emergency dispatch number that UT calls to notify the Knoxville Fire Department of Confined Space entry is 215-1154. The Knoxville Fire Department should be notified prior to a scheduled confined space entry. The emergency dispatch number that UT calls for rescue is 911. The backup agency is the Knoxville Volunteer Rescue Squad.   The local emergency service(s) are required to visit the facility to educate them on the hazards they may confront if responding to a rescue situation. Outside rescue services must have the equipment, capability and proficiency to perform the types of rescues that will be required.   They must be capable of responding to an emergency or rescue condition in a timely manner and agree to inform the Entry Employer when their services are not available. Written Permit System A permit system will be utilized for entry into Permit Spaces. Each canceled entry permit will be retained for at least 1 year to facilitate the review of the permit-required confined space program. Any problems encountered during an entry operation will be noted on the pertinent permit so that appropriate revisions to the permit space program can be made.   Coordinating Entry Operations All outside contractors performing work in confined space entry permit area will be informed of the location of confined spaces, any fire, explosion, health, or other safety hazards of those spaces and any precautions required to control those hazards. This information will be based on an assessment by a competent person and current or past history of the confined space and the nature of the contractor s work procedure in making such disclosure. The Program Administrator or other facility representative will inform contractors of plant safety rules and emergency plans which may be applicable to the contractor s employees.   Contractors and their employees must not be allowed to enter a confined space until the provisions of this program have been satisfied. When personnel and contractor personnel are working in or near permit spaces, entry operations must be coordinated to avoid endangering any personnel. At the conclusion of the entry operations the contractor must be debriefed regarding the permit space program that was followed and concerning any hazards confronted or created in permit spaces during entry operations. It is the responsibility of each contractor who is retained to perform permit space entry operations to obtain any available information regarding permit space hazards and entry operations from the Program Administrator. They must also coordinate entry operations with the Program Administrator when personnel and contractor personnel will be working in or near a permit spaces. The Program Administrator must be informed of the permit space program that the contractor will follow and of any hazards confronted or created in permit spaces, either through a debriefing or during the entry operations. Concluding Entry The entry supervisor will determine when the entry operations have been completed. The permit space will be closed and the permit canceled. The entry supervisor will write  Permit Canceled  with the date, time, and signature at the bottom of the Confined Space Permit Other Precautions and Considerations If welding, cutting or brazing is to be performed in a confined space, ventilation will be provided. A hot work permit will be completed and attached to the confined space entry permit. (See UTK   s Hot Work Program). Cylinders of compressed gas should never be permitted in a confined space. The SDS for any hazardous materials being used in a confined space will be incorporated in the confined space entry permit. Ground-fault interrupter-protected or low voltage power equipment shall be used in confined spaces that are conductive (e.g. a metal tank). Portable electrical equipment should be supplied power through a ground fault interrupter or be battery powered, especially when used in wet environments. If the confined space contains, or is suspect to contain, combustible gases, employees must use explosion-proof or non-spark producing tools ONLY. No smoking is permitted in a Confined Space or near the entrance exit area. Harnesses, lifelines and lifting equipment may need to be provided, depending upon the depth or height of the confined space. The provided equipment must be made to prevent entanglement. For more guidance on fall protection equipment, please refer to UTK   s Fall Protection program.    Excavations (Trenching and Shoring) Some operations such as trenching result in confined spaces. Shoring systems are necessary to protect these spaces and reduce the chance for cave-ins. A trench is a narrow excavation below the ground. Trenches are typically deeper than they are wide  however, the width of a trench is less than 15 feet. A shoring system consists of a structure that supports the sides of an excavation and is designed to prevent cave-ins. Employees must follow all the requirements associated with confined spaces when working within trenches. Training The extent of the training depends upon the employee   s involvement with confined space entry activities.   Training must be provided to each affected employee to ensure the employee possesses the understanding, knowledge and skills necessary for the safe performance of assigned duties. When training will be provided to each affected employee  Before the employee is first assigned duties. Before there is a change in assigned duties. Whenever there is a change in permit space operations that presents a hazard about which an employee has not previously been trained or an additional permit space has been identified. Whenever the supervisor has reason to believe either that there are deviations from the permit space entry procedures required by 29 CFR 1910.146, 29 CFR 1926.1204 or that there are inadequacies in the employee s knowledge or use of these procedures. Three levels of required formal training  Awareness training  All individuals performing work and entering areas where there are confined spaces are to be informed of the existence, location, and danger posed by each space via signage or training. All manholes and storm drains are considered to be confined spaces. Initial training  Employees working in a confined space must know where this program is located. Employees involved with confined space entry must understand what is required of them and what steps they must take to safely enter a confined space in accordance with this program. Initial training is required before the employee is first assigned duties related to confined space entry. Refresher training  Whenever a supervisor has reason to believe either that there are deviations from entry procedures required by this program or that the employee would benefit from a review of the initial training materials (i.e., employee   s knowledge is inadequate). Pre-Work Review Prior to executing a permit entry, the entry supervisor, attendant, and entrants must gather together to review the completed Confined Space Entry permit assessment that pertains to the space being entered. Specifically, individuals must know  What hazards are present How the hazards have been eliminated or controlled throughout entry What to do if something goes wrong during entry. When training will be provided to each affected employee  Before the employee is first assigned duties under this program. Before there is a change in assigned duties. Whenever there is a change in permit space operations that presents a hazard about which an employee has not previously been trained. Whenever there are deviations from the permit space entry procedures required by this program or that there are inadequacies in the employee s knowledge or use of these procedures. Training content shall include  Duties of Entry Supervisor, Entrant and Attendants UTK   s Confined Space Procedure and other procedures related to confined space entry (i.e. Lockout Tagout, Hot Work, etc.). Hazards of Confined Spaces Use of Air Monitoring Equipment Use of Ventilation Equipment Emergency Action and Rescue Procedures Confined Space Entry Equipment, including Personal Protective Equipment. Regulatory requirements of 29 CFR 1910.146 Permit Required Confined Spaces. Documentation of Training All confined space training, other than awareness training, must be documented. The documentation must include the names of the workers trained, signature or initials of the trainer(s), and the date(s) of training. Training certifications must be available for review by the employees or their authorized representatives. Training rosters shall indicate the employee   s name, date, level of training (i.e. supervisor, entrant and or attendant) and the instructor who performed the training. Training and Duties of a Confined Space Entry Team There are three specific members of a confined space entry team.   They are authorized entrants, attendants, and entry supervisors  their duties are  Authorized Entrants (29 CFR 1926.1208) Know the hazards that may be faced during entry. Recognize the signs and symptoms of hazard exposure. Understand the consequences of hazardous exposure. Use equipment properly. Communicate with the attendant. Alert the attendant when warning signs or symptoms of over-exposure are experienced or when a prohibited condition develops. Exit the permit space quickly when required. Attendants (29 CFR 1926.1209) Know entry hazards. Know behavioral effects of exposure. Maintain accurate entrant identification. Remain outside the permit space. Remains in continuous communication with entrants. Monitor entry activities. Assesses conditions inside and outside the permit space to determine if conditions remain safe and orders authorized entrants from the space when necessary. Summons rescue and emergency services. Prevent unauthorized entry. Perform non-entry rescue. Perform no conflicting duties. Entry Supervisor (29 CFR 1926.1210) Know the potential hazards during entry and work. Determine if acceptable entry conditions are present at a permit space where entry is planned. Terminate entry. Verify that rescue services are readily available and the means for summoning them are operable. Remove unauthorized individuals who enter or try to enter the permit space during entry and work. Determine that entry and work operations remain consistent with entry permit terms and that acceptable entry conditions are maintained. The person authorizing the entry may also serve as the entrant or attendant for the entry. Training for all employees whose work is regulated by this section must acquire the understanding, knowledge, and skills necessary for the safe performance of the duties assigned. Training will be provided to each affected employee  Before the employee is first assigned duties. Before there is a change in assigned duties. Whenever there is a change in permit space operations that presents a hazard about which an employee has not previously been trained or an additional permit space has been identified. Whenever the supervisor has reason to believe either that there are deviations from the permit space entry procedures required by 29 CFR 1910.146, 29 CFR 1926.1204 or that there are inadequacies in the employee s knowledge or use of these procedures. Additional Requirements  The training will establish employee proficiency in the duties required by 29 CFR 1910.146 or 29 CFR 1926.1207 and will establish new or revised procedures, as necessary, for compliance with this standard. The Program Administrator will certify that the training required by the previously mentioned paragraphs has been accomplished. The certification will contain each employee s name, the signatures or initials of the trainers, and the dates of training.   The certification will be available for inspection by employees and their authorized representatives. Only trained attendants, authorized entrants, and personnel authorizing or in charge of entry will work in and around a Permit Space. Recordkeeping The Program Administrator will review this program using the canceled permits that were retained within 1 year after each entry and revise the program, as necessary, to ensure that employees participating in entry operations are protected from permit space hazards. OSHA Permit Required Confined Space Entry Standard requires that an accurate record be maintained for permitted entries and training. The permits for entries shall be maintained for one year after work has been completed. The Program Administrator will review this program using the canceled permits that were retained within 1 year after each entry and revise the program, as necessary, to ensure that employees participating in entry operations are protected from permit space hazards. Records of training that contain the employee name(s), name of trainer and date(s) of training must be maintained for the length of the person   s employment, and be readily available for inspection. EHS shall maintain all equipment calibration records for three years.

Be designated as the only people who can test exposed electrical currents and equipment. Test equipment for damages and defects before use. Must be trained on how to work on energized currents, be familiar with proper precautionary work practices, personal protective equipment, insulating and shielding materials, and the use of insulated tools. Procedures The following practices are to be followed by all employees  A. Electrical Installation Requirements Free from Recognized Hazards - Electrical equipment must be free from recognized hazards that are likely to cause death or serious physical harm. Equipment must be suitable for the installation and use, and must be installed and used in accordance with the National Electrical Code (NEC) and or Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Labeling of Disconnects -Each disconnecting means, must be clearly labeled to indicate the circuit   s function unless it is located and arranged so the purpose is evident. Identification should be specific rather than general and all labels and marking must be durable enough to withstand the environment to which they may be exposed and must include nominal voltage being utilized by the device. Energy from more than one source     motors and motor operated equipment with more than one source of power may have multiple disconnects. Where multiple disconnecting means are provided, a permanent warning sign shall be provided on or adjacent to each disconnecting means. Guarding of Live Parts - Live parts of electric equipment operating at 50 volts or more must be guarded by use of an approved cabinet or in a room or vault that is accessible to qualified persons only. Warning Signage     Entrances to rooms and other guarded locations that contain exposed live parts operating at 50 volts or more shall be marked with conspicuous warning signs forbidding unqualified persons to enter. B. General Wiring Design and Protection New electrical wiring, and the modification, extension or replacement of existing wiring must conform to the requirements of NEC, the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), OSHA and the following  No grounded conductor may be attached to any terminal or lead so as to reverse designated polarity. The grounding terminal or grounding-type device on receptacles, cord connector, or attachment plug may not be used for any purpose other than grounding. Conductors and equipment must be protected from overcurrent above their listed current carrying capacity. All alternating current systems of 50 to 1,000 volts must normally be grounded as required by the NEC and OSHA. The path to ground from circuits, equipment and enclosures must be permanent and continuous. Conductors entering boxes, cabinets or fittings must be protected from abrasion, and openings through which conductors enter must be effectively closed. All pull boxes, junction boxes and fittings must be provided with covers approved for the purpose. If metal covers are used they must be grounded. In completed installations, each outlet box must have a cover, faceplate or fixture canopy. Pull boxes and junction boxes for systems over 600 volts, nominal, must provide complete enclosure, the boxes must be closed by suitable covers securely fastened in place, and the cover must be permanently marked    High Voltage.    Switchboards and panelboards that have exposed live parts must be located in permanently dry locations and accessible to qualified persons only. Panelboards must be mounted in cabinets, cutout boxes or other approved enclosures, and must be dead front unless accessible to qualified persons only. Receptacles installed in damp or wet locations must be suitable for the location Cabinets, cutout boxes, fittings, boxes and panel board enclosures in damp or wet locations must be installed to prevent moisture or water from entering and accumulating within the enclosure. In wet locations the enclosures must be weatherproof. Fixtures, lamp holders, lamps, rosettes, and receptacles may have no live parts normally exposed to employee contact. Screw-base light socket adapters do not maintain ground continuity and may not be used. Multi-plug receptacle adapters may not maintain ground continuity or may overload circuits and must not be used. If additional receptacles are needed in a work location, additional circuits and or receptacles must be installed. Multi-plug power strips with overcurrent protection are acceptable for use with electronic equipment, however, they may not be    daisy-chained    (i.e., two or more power strips plugged into each other in a chain). Electrical equipment, wiring methods and installations of equipment in hazardous classified locations must be intrinsically safe, approved for the location, or safe for the location. C. Requirements for Temporary Wiring Temporary electrical power and lighting installations 600 volts or less, including flexible cords, cables, extension cords and distribution panels, may only be used during and for renovation, maintenance, repair, or experimental work. Temporary wiring may also be used for decorative lighting for special events and similar purposes for a period not to exceed 90 days. The following additional requirements apply  Ground-fault protection (e.g., ground-fault circuit interrupters or GFCI) must be provided on all temporary-wiring circuits, including extension cords, used on construction sites. A GFCI must also be used when extension cords and or equipment are used in wet, damp or conductive locations. In general, all equipment and tools connected by cord and plug must be grounded. Listed or labeled double insulated tools and appliances need not be grounded. Feeders must originate in an approved distribution center, such as a panel board, that is rated for the voltages and currents the system is expected to carry. Branch circuits must originate in an approved power outlet or panel board. Bare conductors or earth returns shall not be used for the wiring of any temporary circuit. Receptacles must be of the grounding type. Unless installed in a complete metallic raceway, each branch circuit must contain a separate equipment- grounding conductor, and all receptacles must be electrically connected to the grounding conductor. Flexible cords and cables must be UL listed and suitable for the location and intended use. Flexible cords may not be  run through holes in walls, ceilings or floors, run through doorways, windows or similar pinch points unless protected from damage  attached to building surfaces, concealed behind building walls, ceilings or floors, or used as a substitute for fixed wiring. Flexible cords and cables must be protected from accidental damage. Sharp corners and projections are to be avoided. Temporary wiring, such as extension cords, should be inspected before each use. Splicing is prohibited. D. Open Conductors, Clearance from Ground Open conductors must be located at least 10 feet above any finished grade, sidewalk or projection  12 feet above areas subject to non-truck traffic  15 feet above areas subject to truck traffic  and 18 feet above public streets, roads or driveways. E. Entrances and Access to Workspace In any workspace where there is electric equipment operating at over 600 volts, there must be at least one entrance at least 24    wide and 6   -6    high to permit escape in the event of an emergency. Any exposed energized conductors operating at any voltage and located near the entrance must be guarded to prevent accidental contact. Any insulated energized conductors operating at over 600 volts and located next to the entrance must also be guarded. F. Working Space about Electric Equipment Sufficient access and working space must be provided and maintained around all electric equipment to permit ready and safe operation and maintenance of the equipment. Working clearances may not be less than 36 inches in front of electric equipment. Except as permitted by OSHA or the NEC, the working space in front of live parts operating at 600 volts or less that requires servicing, inspection or maintenance while energized may not be less than indicated in Table 1 in Appendix A.   This working space shall not be used for storage. G. Working on Electrical Systems - Energized Parts Live parts to which an employee may be exposed will be de-energized, using approved lockout tagout procedures, before the employee works on or near them, unless  Work is performed on or near live parts by qualified persons related to tasks such as testing, trouble- shooting, voltage measuring, etc., provided appropriate safe work practices and personal protective equipment are used or, the live parts operate at less than 50 volts to ground and there is no increased exposure to electrical burns or to explosion due to electric arcs. De-energizing introduces    additional or increased hazards.    (i.e. shutdown of critical fume hood ventilation systems)  De-energizing is not possible due to equipment design or operational limitations. Except for emergency repairs to the extent necessary to safeguard the general public, at least two qualified persons shall be present during  installation, removal, or repair of lines that are energized at more than 600 volts  installation, removal, or repair of de-energized lines if an employee is exposed to contact with other parts energized at more than 600 volts  or installation, removal, or repair of transformers, capacitors, regulators, switch gear or other mechanical equipment, if an employee is exposed to contact with parts energized at more than 600 volts. Always have an observer trained in emergency shutdown and first aid. Follow the one hand rule when working on live circuits, if possible. When employees work on exposed de-energized parts or near enough to them to expose the employee to an electrical hazard, then the following safety related work practices will be followed  Any conductors or parts of electric equipment that have not been properly locked and or tagged out must be treated as energized even if these systems have been de-energized. If the potential exists for an employee to contact parts of fixed electric equipment or circuits that have been de-energized, the circuits energizing the parts must be locked and tagged out. De-energizing Equipment  Safe procedures for de-energizing circuits and equipment will be determined by a qualified person before the circuit or equipment is de-energized. Circuits and equipment to be worked on will be disconnected by the worker from all electric energy sources. Stored electrical energy that might endanger personnel must be safely released prior to the work. Stored non-electrical energy (e.g., hydraulic or pneumatic) in devices that could reenergize electric circuit parts must be blocked or relieved so that circuit parts cannot be accidentally reenergized by the device. A lock and tag must be placed on each disconnecting means used to de- energize circuits and equipment on which work is to be done. Verification of De-energized Condition  The following requirements must be met before any circuit or equipment is considered de-energized or may be worked on as de-energized. A qualified person must activate the equipment operating controls or use other methods to verify that the equipment cannot be restarted. A qualified person must use test equipment to ensure that electrical parts and circuit elements are de-energized. The test must confirm there is no energized condition from induced voltage or voltage backfeed. Test equipment and instruments must be visually inspected for external defects or damage before being used to verify that the equipment or circuit is de-energized. When voltage over 600 volts nominal is tested, the test equipment must be checked for proper operation immediately before and after the test on a known live source. Re-energizing Equipment  The following requirements must be met, in the order given, before circuits or equipment is re-energized, even temporarily  If electrical jumpers, shorts, grounds or other such devices have been used as part of a lockout tagout, a qualified person must conduct tests and visual inspections as necessary to verify that all electrical jumpers, shorts, grounds and other such devices have been removed so that circuits and equipment can be safely energized  Employees potentially exposed to the hazards of re-energizing the circuit must be warned to stay clear  and each employee removes his or her own lock(s) and tag(s). H. Overhead Power Lines When work is to be performed near overhead lines, the lines must be de- energized and grounded whenever possible. If it is not possible to de-energize and ground overhead lines, then other protective measures, such as guarding, isolating or insulating, must be taken before the work is started. These protective measures must prevent direct contact by the qualified person or indirect contact through conductive materials, tools, or equipment. Only qualified persons are allowed to install insulating devices on overhead power transmission and distribution lines. All other persons, and any conductive object used by these employees, may not approach closer than the minimum approach distance of 10 feet when the voltage to ground is 50 kV or less, and 10 ft. + 4 inches for every 10 kV over 50 kV when the voltage to ground is  50 kV. Qualified persons working in the vicinity of energized overhead lines, whether in an elevated position or on the ground, are not allowed to approach any exposed energized parts closer than allowed in the table below unless  The person is insulated from the energized part by using voltage rated gloves, (with sleeves and or hot stick if necessary)  or The energized part is insulated from all other conductive objects at a different potential and from the person  or The person is insulated from all conductive objects that are at a potential different from the energized part. Approach Distances for Qualified Persons Exposed to Alternating Current (OSHA 1910.333 Table S-5) Voltage Range (phase-to- phase) Minimum Approach Distance 300 V and less Avoid contact Over 300 V, not over 750 V 1 ft. 0 in. Over 750 V, not over 2 kV 1 ft. 6 in. Over 2 kV, not over 15 kV 2 ft. 0 in. Over 15 kV, not over 37 kV 3 ft. 0 in. Over 37 kV, no over 87.5 kV 3 ft. 6 in. Over 87.5 kV, not over 121 kV 4 ft. 0 in. Over 121 kV, not over 140 kV 4 ft. 6 in. I. Vehicles and Mechanical Equipment A minimum clearance of 10 feet must be maintained between energized overhead lines and all vehicles or mechanical equipment capable of having parts or its structure elevated (e.g., cranes, mobile scaffolds, elevating platforms, dump trucks, lift trucks, and flatbed trailer cranes). If the voltage of the overhead line is greater than 50 kV, the clearance must be increased by 4 inches for every 10 kV over 50 kV. 6.1 The clearance requirement may be reduced if the vehicle is in transit with its structure lowered. The clearance may be reduced to 4 feet when near energized lines operating at less than 50 kV, or 4 ft. plus 4 inches for every 10 kV over 50 kV. The clearance requirement may be reduced if insulating barriers, rated for the voltage of the line being guarded, are installed to prevent contact with the lines. The barrier may not be attached to the vehicle or its raised structure. The clearance may be reduced to the distance allowed by the design of the insulating barrier. The clearance requirement may be reduced if the equipment is an aerial lift insulated for the voltage involved and the work is performed by a qualified person. The clearance between the uninsulated portion of the lift and the power line may be reduced to the distance given in Table 2 above. Persons working on the ground are not allowed to contact the vehicle or mechanical equipment or any of its attachments, unless  The person uses protective equipment rated for the voltage  or The equipment is located so that no uninsulated part of its structure can provide a conductive path to persons on the ground. Equipment shall not approach closer to the line than 10 feet for voltages less than 50 kV, or 10 feet plus 4 inches for every 10 kV over 50 kV. When any vehicle or mechanical equipment is intentionally grounded, persons may not stand near the point of grounding when there is any possibility of contact with overhead energized lines. Additional precautions (e.g., such as the use of barricades or insulation) must be taken as necessary to protect persons from hazardous ground potentials that can develop within a few feet or more outward from the grounding point. Unqualified persons shall stay beyond the next utility pole in either direction as a minimum. Qualified persons on the ground shall establish boundaries (i.e., plastic red barrier tape stating    DANGER     Do Not Enter   ) as a first priority to prevent unqualified persons from entering the restricted work area. Vehicles not directly associated with the operation shall be spotted beyond the next utility pole in either direction as a minimum. J. Energized Electrical Work Permit Before any work is performed on live electrical equipment, an energized electrical work permit must be completed. See Appendix B for example. The permit is completed and signed by a qualified designee and approved by a Facilities Services Electric Shop Supervisor (or qualified designee), before work may begin. The permit will expire when  work operations covered by this permit have been completed  or the technical requirements listed on the permit are no longer suitable for the hazards present  or the hazard category changes. K. Personal Protective Equipment Electrical safety shoes, long sleeve non-synthetic, low flammability shirts and insulating gloves will be worn when operating or testing 600 volt or higher equipment. Flame retardant work outfits shall be worn by employees who are potentially exposed to high-energy areas capable of igniting clothing as per NFPA 70E. Equipment should be inspected before each use. An air test should be performed on lineman   s gloves, along with the inspection. Gloves should conform to ASTM standards based upon the voltage protection required. Protector gloves can be worn over the lineman   s gloves when needed for flash protection. Only face shields with arc rating exposures can be used. Safety glasses must always be worn under face shields and hoods. Flash suits should be worn in extreme high voltage situations ( 1 kV). Steel-toed shoes may not be worn when working around live, exposed electrical equipment. Do not wear clothes that are so tight that they restrict your freedom of movement, or so loose that they get caught in equipment. Before starting work, button shirt cuffs and remove neckties. Employees should not wear conductive articles of clothing or jewelry (i.e. rings, key chains, etc...). Wear well insulated shoes. If you have long hair, restrain it. L. General Precautions Two people should always be present during electrical operations, and one of those people should be trained in emergency procedures. Always have an observer trained in emergency shutdown and first aid. Follow the one hand rule when working on live circuits, if possible. Treat all exposed wiring and electrical parts as potentially live until it has been checked with a meter. Make sure area you are working is properly illuminated before working on exposed wires. Do not reach into blind areas. All ladders used near exposed energized sources must have non- conductive side rails and must be clean (free of oil, grease or contamination that would cause it to be conductive). Never work around a source of electricity when you are wet, it is raining, or your surroundings, tools or clothes are wet. Keep a towel handy for drying your hands and change your clothes if they become wet. All housekeeping duties should not be performed close to live parts, unless adequate safeguards are provided. Electrically conductive cleaning materials, such as steel wool, should not be used near energized parts. Where flammable or ignitable materials are present, do not use electric equipment capable of igniting them unless measures are taken to prevent hazardous conditions from developing. M. Hand tools and Plug in Equipment Never yank cords from their receptacles Never carry tools by the cord or hose Inspect cords before each shift Non-cord carrying metal parts of cord and plug connected equipment must be grounded unless the equipment is double insulated The 3rd wire serves as a conductor that is connected in conjunction with the system ground. Keep cords away from heat, oil and sharp edges Disconnect tool when changing bits, blades and accessories Make sure tools are UL listed and must meet NEC Standards for double insulation or 3rd wire power cord grounding. Use grounded electrical outlets and don   t overload them. Never remove the grounding prong to make the plug fit into a two-prong socket. Always choose the right tool for the job and never modify tools. Don   t use tools with gaps, cracks or tears in the insulation N. Extension cord Safety Guidelines Extension cords provide a convenient method of bringing AC power to a device that is not located near a power source. They are also used as temporary power sources. As such, extension cords are heavily used. They are also often involved in electrical code and safety violations.   Improper use of extension cords can lead to shock hazards. In addition, use of an undersized extension cord results in an overheated cord and insufficient voltage delivered to the device, thus causing device or cord failure and a fire hazard. Extension cords must be approved (by Underwriter Laboratories or another NRTL) and properly maintained with no exposed live parts, exposed ungrounded metal parts, damage, or splices. Extension cords must be made of a heavy-duty or extra-heavy-duty rated cable and must be a continuous length. A spliced cord is never permitted. Around construction sites, in damp areas, or in an area where a person may be in direct contact with a solidly grounded conductive object such as working in a wash bay, extension cords must be protected by a ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI). The GFCI can consist of a special circuit breaker, a GFCI outlet, or an extension cord with a built-in GFCI. Extension cords should be of sufficient current-carrying capacity to power the device. An undersized cord is a fire hazard. Extension cords must be three-conductor (grounded) even if the device has a two-conductor cord. Never use two-conductor extension cords at UT. (Equipment grounding conductors that are part of flexible cords or used with fixture wires shall not be smaller than 18 AWG copper and not smaller than the circuit conductors.) Cord repair is not encouraged. In the event it becomes necessary  only qualified personnel may make repairs of extension cords. There are very few acceptable combinations of extension cords and devices. Some acceptable combinations are  Extension cord to device (electrical equipment) Power strip to device Surge protector (with cord) to device Direct surge protector to extension cord to device Direct surge protector to power strip to device For examples of acceptable and unacceptable combinations of extension cords and power strips, see Figure 1. The examples have been chosen as representative of applications found at UT, however acceptable and unacceptable combinations are not limited to the examples. For questions on a particular application of extension cord or power strip use, please contact the Office of Environmental Health & Safety, University Facilities Services Electric Shop. Figure 1 below shows acceptable and unacceptable combinations of extension cords and power strips.  caption id= attachment_1617  align= alignnone  width= 925   Diagrams of acceptable and unacceptable combinations of extension cords and power strips.

Training documentation will be kept for all affected employees indefinitely. Training and Information Requirements Any employees whose job duties do not bring them close enough to exposed parts of electrical circuits (50 volts or more to the ground) do not need electrical safety training. Unqualified persons, including those employees who use power tools, perform services of equipment and machines and or perform maintenance or repair functions on electrical equipment, and who are close enough to exposed parts of electrical circuits (50 volts or more to the ground), require electrical safety training. Training must be performed before the employee is assigned duties involving work around or on electrical systems. Retraining will be performed whenever inspections performed by the employee   s supervisor or EHS indicate that an employee does not have the necessary knowledge or skills to safely work on or around electrical systems. Retraining will also be performed when policies or procedures change and or new equipment or systems are introduced into the work area. Qualified Persons must be trained in the following  Can distinguish exposed energized parts from other parts of electrical equipment. Determine the nominal voltage of exposed energized parts Know what personal protective equipment to wear and understand flash protection boundaries. Approach distances Must be trained on the specific equipment they will work with. Medical services and first aid and rescue equipment Lockout Tagout Understand the specific hazards associated with electrical energy. Understand safety related work practices. Be familiar with UTKs electrical safety policy. Understand the energized electrical work permit system.

Guidance Welding Hazards Welding joins pieces of metal by the use of heat, pressure, or both. There are more than 80 different types of welding processes.   Three major types of welding processes include  Gas     Slower and easier to control than electric arc. Uses gas flame over metals until molten puddle is formed.   Most popular fuels used with oxygen include acetylene, mapp gas, and hydrogen. Arc     Two metals are joined by generating an electric arc between a covered metal electrode and the base metal. Oxygen and Arc Cutting     Metal cutting in welding is the severing or removal of metal by a flame or arc. The most common cutting processes include  Oxygen Cutting  Metal is heated by gas flame and an oxygen jet does the cutting. Arc Cutting  Intense heat of electric arc melts away the metal. Examples of common types of welding include  arc welding, plasma welding, welding processes that use oxy-acetylene gas (SAW), lasers, and electron beams. Welding can generate toxic fumes and gases. Brazing or soldering involves a filler metal or alloy (combination of metals) which has a lower melting point than the metals being joined. The filler materials (such as lead and cadmium) can be very toxic. Cutting involves heating the metal with a flame and directing a steam of pure oxygen along the line to be cut. Factors affecting worker exposure include  Type of welding process Base metal and filler metals used Welding rod composition Location (outside vs. enclosed space) Welder work practices Air movement Use of ventilation controls Both health and physical hazards are associated with welding depending upon the welding process, the base material, the filler material, and the shielding gas that may be used. Health hazards may be either acute or chronic.   The following are the most common  Burns Electrical shock and burns Infrared and ultraviolet eye injury from looking at the arc without eye protection Lung irritation or poisoning from toxic gases or fumes from the welding operation Musculoskeletal injuries from posture, heavy lifting Physical Hazards associated with welding operations include  Fire Potential Explosion when welding in close proximity to closed containers that have held flammable liquids or other combustible materials Potential Flash fire when welding in close proximity to flammable or combustible vapors at the worksite Noise exposure possibly resulting in permanent hearing loss. Electrical hazards  danger of electric shock Potential health hazards depend on metal being welded and the composition of the welding electrode. Welding or cutting on work pieces that have metallic alloys have potential to be especially hazardous.   Welding metals generates welding fumes, which can include toxic metals, such as  aluminum, antimony, arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, copper, iron, lead, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, silver, tin, titanium, vanadium and zinc. Acute health effects of breathing welding fumes result in eye, nose and throat irritation, dizziness and nausea.   Workers who begin experiencing these symptoms should leave the work area immediately and seek fresh air and medical attention. .   Health effects from certain fumes can cause metal fume fever, stomach ulcers, kidney failure and nervous system damage. Prolonged exposure to manganese fumes can cause Parkinson   s-like symptoms. Long term exposure to welding fumes may cause lung cancer, and other types of cancer, such as larynx and urinary tract cancer. Welding fumes can also generate toxic gases generated from shielding, such as argon, helium, nitrogen, carbon dioxide. Other gases are generated from processes, such as  nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, ozone, phosgene, hydrogen fluoride and carbon dioxide. Chromium is a component in stainless steel, nonferrous alloys, chromate coatings, and some welding consumables.   Chromium is converted to its hexavalent state during the welding process. Hexavalent chromium fumes are highly toxic, and can damage the eyes, skin, nose, throat and lungs and can cause cancer. OSHA regulates worker exposure to hexavalent chromium under its chromium standard, 29 CFR 1910.1026 and 1926.1126. OSHA   s Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) for hexavalent chromium is 5  g m3 as an 8 hour time weighted average. Some types of welding, including shielded metal arc welding, has the potential to produce nitrogen oxides in significant quantities. However, this is not usually an issue in open shop areas with adequate ventilation. Gas Metal Arc (GMA) welding can result in possible inhalation of phosgene gas. Gases, such as helium, argon, and carbon dioxide displace oxygen in the air, and can lead to suffocation (especially when working in confined spaces). Carbon dioxide can form, causing a serious asphyxiation hazard. Other names for metal fume fever include     zinc fume fever   ,    brass chills   , or    brass founders ague   . Although metal fume symptoms do not typically last more than a day, it is possible to get metal fume fever more than once. Zinc and copper metal oxides are usually the metals associated with metal fume fever. Radiation exposure is also a risk during welding.    Flash burn    or    arc eye    is an acute condition due to exposures to ultraviolet light while SMA welding.   The radiation is absorbed by the cornea and causes severe photo keratitis. The UV radiation from inert gas shielded operations will cause skin reddening  therefore, the welder must protect their face, neck and arms. Welding, cutting, and allied processes produce molten metal, sparks, slag, and hot work surfaces can cause fire or explosion if precautionary measures are not followed.   Flying sparks are the main cause of fires and explosions in welding and cutting. Sparks can travel up to 35 feet from the work area. Sparks and molten metal can travel greater distances when falling.   Sparks can pass through or become lodged in cracks, clothing, pipe holes, and other small openings in floors, walls, or partitions. Typical combustible materials found inside buildings include  wood, paper, rags, clothing, chemicals, flammable liquids and gases, and dusts. Parts of buildings such as floors, partitions, and roofs may also be combustible. Welding and cutting can cause explosions in spaces containing flammable gases, vapors, liquids, or dusts. Below, is a table illustrating the type of fumes and the health effects after being exposed to these fumes. Source Effects and Symptoms Fumes Aluminum Aluminum component of some alloys, e.g., copper, zinc, steel, magnesium, brass and filler materials. Respiratory irritant. Beryllium Hardening agent found in copper, magnesium, aluminum alloys and electrical contacts.    Metal Fume Fever.    A carcinogen. Other chronic effects include damage to the respiratory tract.

Increased cancer risk has been noted in occupations other than welding. Also associated with dermatitis and lung problems. Vanadium Some steel alloys, iron, stainless steel, nickel alloys. Acute effect is irritation of the eyes, skin and respiratory tract. Chronic effects include bronchitis, retinitis, fluid in the lungs and pneumonia. Zinc Oxides Galvanized and painted metal. Metal Fume Fever Gases Carbon Monoxide Formed in the arc. Absorbed readily into the bloodstream, causing headaches, dizziness or muscular weakness. High concentrations may result in unconsciousness and death. Hydrogen Fluoride Decomposition of rod coatings. Irritating to the eyes and respiratory tract. Overexposure can cause lung, kidney, bone and liver damage. Chronic exposure can result in chronic irritation of the nose, throat and bronchi. Nitrogen Oxide Formed in the arc. Eye, nose and throat irritation in low concentrations. Abnormal fluid in the lung and other serious effects at higher concentrations. Chronic effects include lung problems such as emphysema. Oxygen Deficiency Welding in confined spaces, and air displacement by shielding gas. Dizziness, mental confusion, asphyxiation and death. Ozone Formed in the welding arc, especially during plasma-arc, MIG and TIG processes. Acute effects include fluid in the lungs and hemorrhaging. Very low concentrations (e.g., one part per million) cause headaches and dryness of the eyes. Chronic effects include significant changes in lung function. Organic Vapors Aldehydes (such as formaldehyde) Metal coating with binders and pigments. Degreasing solvents. Irritant to eyes and respiratory tract. Di-isocyanates Metal with polyurethane paint. Eye, nose and throat irritation. High possibility of sensitization, producing asthmatic or other allergic symptoms, even at very low exposures. Phosgene Metal with residual degreasing solvents. (Phosgene is formed by reaction of the solvent and welding radiation.) Severe irritant to eyes, nose and respiratory system. Symptoms may be delayed. Phosphine Metal coated with rust inhibitors. (Phosphine is formed by reaction of the rust inhibitor with welding radiation.) Irritant to eyes and respiratory system, can damage kidneys and other organs. Heat Stress and Cold Stress during Welding  Precautions should be taken and work schedules adjusted to ensure that every worker   s core body temperature is maintained.   If fluids are not taken to replace those lost by sweating, heat exhaustion can occur. Eye injury Radiation from welding arcs resulting in eye damage include  Arc welding  from UV radiation Cataracts l from UV and IR radiation Retinal burns (from both visible or IR radiation) UV radiation is the most likely to cause injury, because its effects are not noticed during the time of exposure. Ventilation Guidelines for Welding, Cutting and Brazing Operations There are two major types of ventilation that can be utilized to protect from harmful welding fumes, which include general ventilation and local exhaust ventilation. General or Dilution Ventilation  Relies on diluting airborne contaminants with fresh air from open doors, windows or fans, and is acceptable for less hazardous air contaminants.   General ventilation provides enough air movement to keep the fumes and gases out of the welder   s breathing zone.   Workers should position themselves to avoid breathing welding fumes and gases. For example, welders should stay upwind when welding in open or outdoor environments. Welding outdoors does not guarantee adequate ventilation. In work areas without ventilation and exhaust systems, welders should use natural drafts and proper positioning to keep fumes and gases away from their breathing zone. If requirements for natural ventilation are not met, then the area needs to be mechanically ventilated. Ventilation must exhaust at least 2,000 cubic feet per minute of air for each welder, except  Where local exhaust hoods or booths are used Where air-line respirators are used. Local Exhaust Ventilation (LEV)  Local exhaust ventilation is much more effective in controlling welding fumes and gases because it captures the fumes and gases close to the source and keeps them from entering the welder s breathing zone.   This is usually accomplished by the use of hoods and ducts. Welding must not be done in confined spaces without ventilation.   Local exhaust ventilation may consist of freely movable hoods designed to be placed by the welder as close as practical to the work. The system shall be capable of removing fumes and smoke at the source and keep the concentration of them in the breathing zone at a safe distance.   The contaminated air exhausted from the workspace must be discharged in the open air, or clear of the source of intake air. Oxygen and compressed air cannot be used for ventilation purposes, blowing off dust, or cleaning clothes.   Hoods and ductwork should be constructed of fire-resistant materials. Welding booths should be painted with a dull finish that does not reflect UV light. To be effective, local exhaust ventilation must  Be close to the welding arc or flame where the fumes, gases and heat are generated, Have enough velocity to draw away the contaminants. Ensure protection from fume and gases by (depending on circumstances) one or a combination of  Good general ventilation (generally limited to less hazardous air contaminants) Use of a booth Local exhaust ventilation such as fume hoods and ducts Movable hoods placed as close to the work as practical and provided with a rate of 100 feet per minute in the zone of welding when the hood is at its most remote distance from the point of welding. The rates of ventilation required to accomplish this velocity using a 3-inch wide flanged suction opening accordance with 29 CFR 1910.252(c)(3)(i) are shown in the following table  Welding Zone Minimum air flow cubic feet minute Duct diameter, inches 4 to 6 inches from arc or torch 150 3 6 to 8 inches from arc or torch 275 3    8 to 10 inches from arc or torch 425 4    10 t o12 inches from arc or torch 600 5    Ventilation Requirements for Welding and Cutting     1910 Standards  Metal Compound Requirements Confined Space Requirements Indoors Requirements Outdoors Fluorine Compound Air replacement or airline respirator or self-contained breathing apparatus needed Air sample tests to determine if exhaust hood, booth, and airline respirator are required Same as indoors Lead, Zinc, Galvanized Compounds Air replacement or airline respirator or self-contained breathing apparatus Exhaust hood or booth Combination particulate   and vapor and gas removing type respirator if tests indicate need Beryllium Exhaust hood or booth and airline respirator if air sample tests indicate need Exhaust hood or booth and airline respirator if air sample tests indicate need Exhaust hood or booth and airline respirator if air sample tests indicate need Cadmium Mercury Exhaust hood or booth and airline respirator if air sample tests indicate need Exhaust hood or booth and airline respirator if air sample tests indicate need Combination particulate and vapor and gas removing type respirator if tests indicate need Airline or self-contained breathing apparatus are required in confined areas that are immediately hazardous to life. Local exhaust hoods or booths must provide airflow of at least100 linear feet per minute. Mechanical ventilation at 2,000 cubic feet of air per minute per welder is required when welding or cutting on metals other than described above  when there is less than 10,000 cubic feet of space per welder  or where the ceiling height is less than 16 feet  or in confined spaces or where structural barriers (such as partitions or balconies) significantly obstruct cross ventilation. 1910.252(c)(2)(i)(A) through (C). Note  Mechanical ventilation is necessary when an exhaust hood or fixed booth provide for a rate of airflow sufficient to maintain a velocity away from the welder or not less than 100 linear feet per minute. Welding in Confined Spaces  General or LEV must be provided when working in confined spaces.   When sufficient ventilation cannot be achieved without blocking means of access, workers must be protected by airline respirators, and an employee must be stationed outside the confined space to aid them in an emergency. When the welder enters the confined space, they must be attached to a lifeline so that they can quickly be removed. When welding with materials containing zinc, lead cadmium and chromium in enclosed spaces, LEV, or respiratory protection must be provided.   When working with beryllium compounds, LEV and airline respirators must be provided.   Specific OSHA requirements exist under 29 CFR 1926.353 for workers performing certain types of arc welding operations in confined spaces. The following safety guidelines should be followed when performing various welding operations  Electric Welding and Cutting  Perform Safety Check on all equipment Ensure fire extinguisher is charged and available. Perform Safety Check on all equipment Ensure electrical cord, electrode holder and cables are free from defects (no cable splices are allowed within 10 feet of the electrode holder. Ensure PPE (welding hood, gloves, rubber boots soled shoes, aprons) are available and have no defects. Ensure the welding unit is properly grounded. Examine equipment frequently to determine that all electrical connections and insulations on holders and cables are in good condition. Loose cable connections may overheat or arc cause a fire. Keep welding cables dry, grease and oil-free, and protected from sparks or hot metal. Store welding rods in the container on the welding machine  do not throw on floors or staging. Set Voltage Regulator no higher than the following for  Manual Alternating Current Welders     80 volts. Automatic Alternating Current Welders     100 volts. Manual or automatic Direct Current Welders     100 volts. Uncoil and spread out welding cable. To ensure proper contact of work leads and connection. To remove any metal fragments from magnetic work clamps (to avoid electric shock do not wrap welding cables around a body part and avoid welding in wet conditions). Avoid overheating  Prior to spot welding, the material is usually cleaned in a caustic or slightly acid bath. Employees performing these wash operations shall be protected from splashing liquid. The operator shall make necessary adjustment to the contactors. In hand spot welding installations, eye protection shall be required to protect the operator from the spattering metal. Welding of materials such as stainless and high carbon steels causes excessive spattering of metal. Operators shall be cautioned to protect against the possible penetration of the metal into the tips of the fingers. Gas Welding and Cutting Perform Safety Check on all equipment Ensure tanks have gas and fittings are tight. Ensure fire extinguisher is charged and available. Ensure hoses have no defects. Ensure PPE (welding hood, gloves, rubber boots soled shoes, aprons) are available and have no defects. All defective equipment must be repaired or replaced before use. Remove flammables and combustibles Remove all nearby flammable or combustible materials before striking an arc or lighting a flame. Remove all flammable and readily combustible materials from your pockets, such as matches and cigarette lighters. Place welding screen or suitable barricade around work area to provide a fire safety zone and prevent injuries to passersby. Welding Operators Protection (See more details in PPE policy GS 50) Before beginning a welding job, it is very important to identify the hazardous for that particular welding operation.   Welders should understand the hazards they are working with. A Safety Data Sheet (SDS) should be provided to identify the hazardous materials used in the welding operation.     Less hazardous materials can be substituted for some welding chemicals, such as cadmium    free solders and asbestos-free electrodes, gloves and hot pads. Welding surfaces should be cleaned of any coatings that could potentially create toxic exposure, such as paint and solvent residue. Workers should position themselves to avoid breathing welding fumes and gases. For example, welders should stay upwind when welding in open or outdoor environments. Welders need to be protected against heat, sparks, ultraviolet rays, hot slag, fumes and toxic gases.   Make sure employees are outfitted with the following personal protective equipment (PPE)  Personal Protective Equipment  Body Protection  Clothing should provide sufficient coverage, and be made of suitable materials, to minimize skin burns caused by sparks, splatter, or radiation. Keep clothing dry and change when needed to reduce risk of electric shock. Keep clothing clean (free of grease, oil and solvents, which can catch fire and burn easily). Do not wear synthetic fabrics  wear cotton or wool. Protective clothing and equipment shall be suitable for the type of work to be performed, kept in good repair, and kept free of oil and grease. Sleeves shall be kept buttoned at the wrist. Collars shall be kept buttoned. Fire-resistant gloves and aprons shall be worn during welding, flame cutting and brazing processes. Safety shoes should be worn to protect the operator from spark hazard. Eye and Face Protection Safety glasses, goggles, face shields, helmets, or other suitable eye protection having the proper lens shade for the work being done shall be worn during all welding, cutting, and brazing operations. Fire Watch personnel shall wear eye and face protection as appropriate. Wear flame resistant gloves (such as leather welder   s) that are dry, hole-free and insulated. Goggles shall be ventilated to prevent fogging of the lenses as much as practicable. Goggles, helmets, and face shields shall be checked frequently. The following table is a guide for the selection of the proper shade numbers. These recommendations may be varied to suit the individual   s needs in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.252(b) (2) (ii) (H) of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Welding operation Shade No. Shielded metal-arc welding 1 16, 3 32, 1 8, 5 32-inch electrodes 10 Gas-shielded arc welding (nonferrous) 1 16, 3 32, 1 8, 5 32-inch electrodes 11 Gas-shielded arc welding (ferrous) 1 16, 3 32, 1 8, 5 32-inch electrodes 12 Shielded metal-arc welding  3 16, 7 32, 1 4 inch electrodes 12 Shielded metal-arc welding     5 16, 3 8-inch electrodes 14 Atomic hydrogen welding 10     14 Carbon arc welding 14 Soldering 2 Torch brazing 3 or 4 Light cutting, up to 1 inch 3 or 4 Medium cutting, 1 inch to 6 inches 4 or 5 Heavy cutting, 6 inches and over 5 or 6 Gas welding (light) up to 1 8 inch 4 or 5 Gas welding (medium) 1 8 inch to 1 2 inch 5 or 6 Gas welding (heavy) 1 2 inch and over 6 or 8 NOTE  In gas welding or oxygen cutting where the torch produces a high yellow light, use a filter or lens that absorbs the yellow Head protection Head protection made of a flame resistant material shall be worn. Respiratory Protection (for more information, refer to Respiratory Policy IH-003) Engineering controls and safe work practices are the primary means to prevent employee over exposure to welding fumes, toxic gases, and dusts. Employees will not perform welding that cannot be safely done without the use of a respirator. Employees will follow the requirements for respirator use set forth in UT   s Respirator Protection policy. Hearing Protection (for more information, refer to Hearing Conservation Policy IH-010). Devices may be required during some welding operations. If loud noise is present, approved ear plugs or ear muffs shall be worn to prevent hearing loss. Foot and Leg Protection Wear leather, steel-toed, high top boots in good condition In heavy spark and slag areas, used fire-resistant foot protectors or leather spats strapped around pant legs and boot tops. Do not tuck pant legs into boots. OSHA Required Designated Signs  All filler metals and fusible granular materials shall carry the following notice, as a minimum on tags, boxes or other containers  CAUTION  Welding may produce fumes and gases hazardous to health. Avoid breathing these fumes and gases. Use adequate ventilation. Sen ANSI Z49.1-1967 Safety in Welding and Cutting published by the American Welding Society. Brazing filler metals containing cadmium in significant amounts shall carry the following notice on tags, boxes and other containers  WARNING CONTAINS CADMIUM-POISONOUS FUMES MAY BE FORMED ON HEATING Do not breathe fumes. Use only with adequate ventilation such as fume collectors, exhaust ventilators, or air-supplied respirators. See ANSI Z49.1-1967 Brazing and gas welding fluxes containing fluorine compounds shall have a cautionary wording to indicate that they contain fluorine compounds. One such cautionary wording recommended by the American Welding Society for brazing and gas welding fluxes reads as follows  CAUTION CONTAINS FLUORIDES This flux when heated gives off fumes that may irritate eyes, nose and throat. Avoid fumes   use only in well-ventilated spaces. Avoid contact of flux with eyes or skin. Do not take internally. Hot Work Areas All hot work shall be performed in a Designated Hot Work Area, if possible. A Designated Hot Work Area must meet the following requirements  The Designated Hot Work Area shall be a discrete area, sectioned off by noncombustible walls, or curtains. Adequate ventilation, such as a suction hood system providing 20 air changes per hour, should be provided for the work area. Where welding, cutting and brazing are done near walls, partitions, ceilings, or a roof of combustible construction, fire-resistant shields or guards shall be provided to prevent ignition. Protective dividers such as welding curtains or non-combustible walls will be provided to contain sparks and slag to the combustible free area. Flammable and combustible liquids and material will be kept 35 feet from work area. Floors shall be swept and clean of combustibles within 35 feet of work area. A fire extinguisher should be within access of the 35 feet of work area, and shall be maintained in a state of readiness for instant use. Hot Work Procedures All hot work permits shall be returned to the issuing supervisor when the hot work has been completed. Supervisor and employee are responsible for identifying and controlling workplace hazards before hot work is performed. Hot Work Permit (for non-designated hot work area) will be issued for a period covering the duration of hot work. Prior to Hot Work Inspect the hot work area to identify any fire hazards. Remove all flammable or combustible materials within a thirty five (35) foot radius of the hot work. Sweep floor of all loose combustible debris. Place non-combustible or flame resistant screens so as to protect personnel in adjacent work areas from heat, flames, radiant energy and welding splatter. Cover sprinkler heads directly above the hot work area with wet rags or other non-combustible materials so they will not be triggered during the work if the hot work area has any. Cover smoke detectors located in close proximity of the work area, or notify the electrical shop to deactivate smoke detectors in the hot work area. Notify anyone nearby who may be affected by the work. Make provisions for proper ventilation During Hot Work Combustible floors shall be kept wet during the hot work. Store acetylene and other fuel cylinders in a secure and upright position. Place hoses so that they will not be crushed or damaged. After Hot Work Remove any covers from sprinkler heads immediately upon completion of the hot work if the hot work area has any. Remove covers from any smoke detectors immediately upon completion of the hot work, or notify the electrical shop to reactivate them if they have been deactivated. Clean up any slag, debris or used electrodes resulting from the work. Restore ventilation to its original condition. Hot Work in Areas not designated as Hot Work Areas. When welding, cutting, or brazing work is to be done outside of a Designated Hot Work Area, it is necessary to meet the following requirements  A Hot Work Permit is required for all Hot Work. See UT   s Hot Work Policy FS 15 found in the Safety Manual. Flammable materials that cannot be removed from the area must be adequately covered or guarded before hot work is started. All floor openings and cracks shall be closed, sealed and or covered to ensure that sparks cannot drop into the openings and come into contact with combustible materials. Guards, shields, and or fire-blankets shall be used to confine the heat, sparks and or slag from coming into contact with any combustible material with 35 feet of the hot work Portable welding curtains or shields must be used to protect other workers in the welding area. Airflow away from the welder and others present must be established and maintained. Plastic materials must be covered with welding tarps during welding procedures. Suitable fire extinguishing equipment shall be maintained in a state of readiness at all times for instant use. This may include fire extinguishers, water hoses or buckets of sand, depending on the nature of the combustible material exposed Prohibited Hot Work Areas Areas that are prohibited from conducting hot work include  Areas not authorized by management. Areas equipped with sprinkler systems that are out of order. In the presence of potentially explosive atmospheres, e.g., a flammable liquid. Areas where combustible or flammable materials are within 35 feet and cannot be moved or protected. Areas where appropriate fire fighting equipment is not readily available. Areas where floor and wall openings cannot be covered. Fire Watch  Fire Watchers shall be required whenever these activities are performed in locations where other than a minor fire might develop.   The Fire Watcher  Shall be present to ensure that sparks, slag and heat generated by the hot work do not start a fire while the welder is working. Shall remain at the work location for at least thirty (30) minutes after the hot work has been completed to ensure that no sparks or slag are smoldering and that the heat generated by the hot work did not cause other materials to smolder thus creating a potential fire hazard. Shall be trained in the proper use of fire extinguishing equipment and be prepared to use it. Shall be familiar with facilities for sounding an alarm in the event of a fire or other emergency situation. Shall also be trained to react to other potential hazards associated with the work activity such as exposure to welding fumes, welding flash and any other potential hazards unique to the area in which the work is being performed. The person performing hot work and the Fire Watch shall be required to read the Hot Work Permit and sign the permit acknowledging the fact that they understand the potential hazards and will follow the requirements of the permit. If feasible, floors shall be wetted, or covered with a fire blanket, fire pad, or other flame resistant material prior to start of hot work to prevent ignition. More information on fire watch requirements may be found in the UT Fire Watch Procedure FS 011. Equipment Inspection and Handling Inspect cylinders, regulators and hoses before use. A hammer or wrench shall not be used to open cylinder valves. If valves cannot be opened by hand, the supplier shall be notified. When a special wrench is required it shall be left in position on the stem of the valve while the cylinder is in use so that the fuel-gas flow can be quickly turned off in case of emergency. Smoking is never allowed for your safety and the safety of others. Inspect the cylinder and the gas identification tag. Unless cylinders are secured on a special truck, regulators shall be removed and valve-protection caps, when provided, shall be put in place before cylinders are moved. Inspect the work area for grease or oils before use of compressed gas. Always use regulators for all gas cylinder hookups, valves must be fully shut off when not in use. Use only non-sparking tools for flammable gases. Be sure the cylinder is secure in the work area. You should limit pressure to 30 psi or less for air blow down. Never refill or attempt to repair a gas cylinder. Remove leaking cylinders from the building and properly vent all remaining gas. Damaged cylinders should be marked    Damaged-Do not Use   . Be sure to check all hose fittings for compressed air systems by using a control nozzle with self- closing valve at the operators end. Cylinder Storage  Cylinders used for welding, brazing and cutting work shall be stored using the following guidelines.   For more information on cylinder safety refer to UT Cylinder Safety Policy HM 15 found in the Safety Manual. Label and separate the empty cylinders from the full ones. Always install the caps on the cylinder. Store cylinders upright and away from heat sources. Keep the storage area dry and well ventilated. Store oxygen cylinders separately from the other types. Cylinders should be chained or strapped to prevent tipping. Fuel gas and oxygen must be stored at a minimum of 20 feet apart or separated by a one-hour rated fire wall. APPROVED FIRE RESISTANT MATERIALS FOR HOT WORK AREAS  Welding Blanket  A welding blanket is a heat-resistant fabric designed to be placed in the vicinity of a hot work operation. Intended for use in horizontal applications with light to moderate exposures such as that resulting from chipping, grinding, heat treating, sand blasting, and light horizontal welding. They are designed to protect machinery and prevent ignition of combustibles such as wood that are located under the blanket. They are made from different materials such as fiberglass, silica, and other fire resistant materials. Welding Pads  A welding pad is heat-resistant fabric designed to be placed directly under a hot work operation such as welding or cutting.   Welding pads are intended for use horizontal applications with severe exposures such as that resulting from molten substances of heavy horizontal welding. Welding Curtain  A welding curtain is a heat-resistant fabric designed to be placed in the vicinity of a hot work operation.   It is intended for use in vertical application with light to moderate exposures such as that resulting from chipping, grinding, heat treating, and light horizontal welding. It   s designed to prevent sparks from escaping a confined area. *Welding blankets and curtains are required to be listed, approved, or the equivalent for such use. One such approval includes ANSI FM 4950, American National Standard for Evaluating Welding Pads, Welding Blankets and Welding Curtains for Hot Work Operations. Welding and Hot Work In and Around Tanks  Whenever possible, avoid hot work and consider alternative methods.   Analyze the hazards prior to initiation of hot work.   Perform a hazard assessment that identifies the scope of work, potential hazards, and methods of hazard control. Work is not allowed and shall not be performed in or near tanks that contain or have contained flammable liquids. The tanks must be thoroughly drained, purged, and atmospherically tested with a combustible gas meter (indicator) if work will be done on or in the vessel. This will ensure the tank is free from the accumulation of flammable gases or vapors. Once approved safe for hot work, atmospheric monitoring must be performed using a portable combustible gas analyzer before and during the work by only trained personnel Assistance can be obtained with atmospheric monitoring by contacting EHS Department at 974-5084. If any detectable readings are obtained, then work cannot begin or continue until the source of vapor is found and suitably mitigated such that the concentration is maintained below 10% of the Lower Flammable Explosive Limit. For technical assistance regarding combustible gas meters, contact EHS. Electric Shock Hazards and Safety Precautions  Electric shock from electrical welding and cutting equipment can result in death or severe burns. Additionally, serious injury can occur if the welder falls as a result of the shock. This safety hazard is associated with operations that use electricity to generate heat, such as arc and resistance welding and cutting. Employees are to use proper precautionary measures and recommended safe practices at all times to avoid electrical shocks. Personnel using electrical welding and cutting equipment must be trained on safe work practices and procedures before use of this equipment. Some measures to prevent electrical shock include  Never use a bare hand or wet glove to change electrodes Do not touch an energized electrode while you are in contact with the work circuit Never stand on a wet or grounded surface when changing electrodes. Do not allow the electrode holder or electrode to come in contact with any other person or any grounded object. Ground the frames of welding units. Insulate yourself from the workpiece and ground using dry insulating mats or covers big enough to prevent any physical contact with the work or ground, or wear properly designed and approved rubber-soled boots in good condition. If utilizing long lengths of cable, suspend them overhead whenever possible. If run along the floor, be sure they do not create a tripping hazard, become damaged, or tangled. Additional safety precautions are required when welding is performed under any of the following electrical hazardous conditions  in damp locations or while wearing wet clothing, on metal floors, gratings, scaffolds, or other metal structures  in cramped positions such as sitting, kneeling, or lying  or when there is a high risk of unavoidable or accidental contact with the workpiece and ground. Where these conditions are present, use one of the following types of equipment presented in order of preference  Semiautomatic DC constant voltage metal electrode (wire) welder, DC manual covered electrode (stick) welder, AC welder with reduced open-circuit voltage. In most situations, use of a DC constant voltage wire welder is recommended. And do not work alone! Fall Protection and Hot Work  Fall protection used in welding operations presents special challenges, since the hot slag generated from hot work can damage harnesses and other fall protection equipment.   Full body harnesses made of heat resistant material should be used to protect equipment from heat and UV exposure.   All fall protection equipment must be OSHA requirements. Air and Noise Monitoring  Air samples are normally taken within the worker   s breathing zone to determine concentrations (typically during an 8 hour working day) Routine air monitoring should be conducted to determine the levels of hazardous materials and noise in the welding area. EHS can perform hazard monitoring upon request. Medical Monitoring  The early symptoms of harmful exposure to most substances produced during welding are similar. These may consist of irritation of the eyes, nose, respiratory system and sometimes the skin (such as    nickel itch,    caused by exposure to nickel fumes). Coughing, a tight chest or chest pains, headaches, nausea, vomiting and fatigue may also be some persistent symptoms. Since these symptoms are common to many other illnesses, it is important to determine whether or not they are related to work.     NIOSH recommends that all workers exposed to welding processes should receive annual medical exams. Training and Information Training shall be provided to all personnel affected by this procedure and at any time there is a modification to this procedure that will affect work practices.   The degree of training provided shall be determined by the potential hazards of the welding, cutting, and brazing job assignment. Initial training To ensure employees recognize the hazards associated with welding, cutting and brazing operations. To know the safe work practices for welding, cutting and brazing operations. To understand the importance and requirements of Hot Work Permits. To understand the requirements to establish and maintain Hot Work Areas To use the appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) for the job Employees performing the hot work shall be trained in the proper use of the equipment they will be using to perform the hot work. Employees shall be trained in the proper use of the fire extinguishing equipment that is provided for the use of the Fire Watch. Employees shall also be trained in the proper use of any protective equipment or procedures necessary to protect themselves or other personnel in the area and the facility. Additional or refresher training All authorized and affected employees shall receive appropriate training whenever there is a change in their job assignments or a change in welding equipment or processes that present a new hazard. Employees or supervisors have reason to believe that there are deviations from or inadequacies in the employees    knowledge of known hazards, or use of equipment or procedures. Sources of Training  Online sources (EHS website) Traditional classroom programs are available upon request by EHS. Recordkeeping All training records must be documented. Each department must maintain a record of the training. The following information should be contained in the training record  date of training, instructor, name of employee, location and a brief description or outline of what was covered.

Abbreviations and Definitions Abbreviations ACGIH     American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists EHS     campus Environmental Health and Safety PEL     Permissible Exposure Limit TLV     Threshold Limit Value Definitions Aluminum hydraulic shoring  an engineered shoring system comprised of aluminum hydraulic cylinders (cross braces), used in conjunction with vertical rails (uprights) or horizontal rails (walers). Such a system is designed specifically to support the sidewalls of an excavation and prevent cave-ins. Benching  a method of protecting employees from cave-ins by constructing the sides of an excavation to form one or a series of horizontal levels of steps, usually with vertical or near-vertical surfaces between levels. Cave-in  the separation of a mass of soil or rock material from the side of an excavation, or the loss of soil from under a trench shield or support system, and its sudden movement into the excavating, either by falling or sliding, in sufficient quantity so that it could entrap, bury, or otherwise injure and immobilize a person. Competent person  one who is capable of identifying existing and predictable hazards in the surroundings, or working conditions that are unsanitary, hazardous, or dangerous to employees, and who has authorization to take prompt corrective measures to eliminate them. A competent person should have and be able to demonstrate the following  Training, experience, and knowledge of  Soil analysis. Use of protective systems. Requirements of 29 CFR 1926 Subpart P. Ability to detect  Conditions that could result in cave-ins. Failures in protective systems. Hazardous atmospheres. Other hazards including those associated with confined spaces. Authority to take prompt corrective measures to eliminate existing and predictable hazards and to stop work when required. Excavation  any man-made cut, cavity, trench, or depression in an earth surface, formed by earth removal. Registered professional engineer  a person who is registered as a professional engineer. Shield (shield system)  a structure that is able to withstand the forces imposed on it by a cave-in and thereby protect employees within the structure. Shields can be a permanent structure or can be designed to be portable and moved along as work progresses. Also known as trench box or trench shield. Shoring (shoring system)  a structure such as a metal hydraulic, mechanical or timber shoring system that supports the sides of an excavation and which is designed to prevent cave-ins. Sloping (sloping system)  a method of protecting employees from cave-ins by excavating to form sides of an excavation that are inclined away from the excavation so as to prevent cave-ins. The angle of incline varies with differences in such factors as the soil type, environmental conditions of exposure, and application of surcharge loads. Soil Types Type A     Most stable  clay, silty clay, and hardpan (resists penetration). No soil is Type A if it is fissured, is subject to vibration of any type, has been previously been disturbed, or has seeping water. Type B     Medium stability  silt, sandy loam, medium clay and unstable dry rock  previously disturbed soils unless otherwise classified as Type C  soils that meet the requirements of Type A soil but are fissured or subject to vibration. Type C     Least stable  gravel, loamy sand, soft clay, submerged soil or dense, heavy unstable rock, and soil from which water is freely seeping. Layered geological strata (where soils are configured in layers)     The soil must be classified on the basis of the soil classification of the weakest soil layer. Each layer may be classified individually if a more stable layer lies below a less stable layer, i.e. where a Type C soil rests on the top of stable rock. Trench (trench excavation)  a narrow excavation (in relation to its length) made below the surface of the ground. In general, the depth is greater than the width, but the width of a trench is not greater than fifteen (15) feet. If forms or other structures are installed or constructed in an excavation as to reduce the dimension measured from the forms or structure to the side the excavation to one hundred fifty four (154) feet or less, the excavation is also considered to be a trench. Roles and Responsibilities Environmental Health and Safety shall  Assist supervisors with employee training upon request Review and revise this procedures Provide interpretations of this procedure where the intent is not clear Investigate complaints involving trenching and shoring activities under the control of UTK. Conduct safety assessment upon request of projects involving trenching and shoring Recommend controls and protective measures regarding trenches and excavations Investigate any accidents in trenches or excavations Conduct air monitoring for hazardous gases upon request in trenches and excavations Departments who have staff, faculty or students who enter trenches or excavations shall  Ensure the individuals are properly trained and follow this procedure Provide any required safety equipment Assign a competent person to each excavation Competent persons shall  Prohibit unauthorized individuals from entering trenches and excavations Evaluate soils conditions Conduct and document inspections of trenches and excavations Ensure no utilities are likely to be damaged prior to excavation Staff or faculty who enter trenches and excavations shall  Prohibit students under their supervision from entering trenches that are more than four feet in depth. Participate in training Stop work in the event of imminent danger or when ordered by a competent person Follow the requirements established during training Report any problems, accidents, near misses or other hazards associated with trenching and excavation to their supervisor. Procedures All excavations shall be made in accordance with the rules, regulations, requirements, and guidelines set forth in 29 CFR 1926.650, 651, and .652  the Occupational Safety and Health Administration   s standard on Excavations, except where otherwise noted below. A. Procedures A competent person shall be placed in charge of all excavations and shall be onsite at all times. Note that more than one person onsite may meet the qualifications for a competent person. Underground utilities must be located and marked before excavation begins. Employees are not allowed in the excavation or trench while heavy equipment is digging. Provisions (e.g. fence, barricade) shall be made to prevent unauthorized individuals from accessing trenches or excavations more than four feet in depth. B. Inspections The competent person shall conduct inspections  Daily and before the start of each shift. As dictated by the work being done in the trench. After every rainstorm. After other events that could increase hazards, such as snowstorm, windstorm, thaw, earthquake, dramatic change in weather, etc. When fissures, tension cracks, sloughing, undercutting, water seepage, bulging at the bottom of the trench or excavation or other similar conditions occur. When there is a change in the size, location, or placement of the spoil pile. When there is any indication of change or movement in adjacent structures. For excavations and trenches four (4) feet or greater in depth, a trench inspection form shall be filled out for each inspection.   See Appendix B (trench inspection form) C. Testing Methods The competent person in charge of the excavation shall be responsible for determining whether the soil is Type B or C. The competent person shall use a visual test coupled with one or more manual tests. D. Visual test In addition to checking the items on the trench inspection form, the competent person should perform a visual test to evaluate the conditions around the site. In a visual test, the entire excavation site is being observed, including the soil adjacent to the site and the soil being excavated. The competent person also checks for any signs of vibration. During the visual test, the competent person should check for crack-line openings along the failure zone that would indicate tension cracks, look for existing utilities that indicate that the soil has been previously disturbed, and observe the open side of the excavation for indications of layered geologic structuring. This person should also look for signs of bulging, boiling, or sloughing, as well as for signs of surface water seeping from the sides of the excavation or from the water table. In addition, the area adjacent to the excavation should be checked for signs of foundations or other intrusions into the failure zone, and the evaluator should check for surcharging and the spoil distance from the edge of the excavation. E. Manual tests Thumb penetration test. Attempt to press the thumb firmly into the soil in question. If the thumb penetrates no further than the length of the nail, it is probably type B soil. If the thumb penetrates the full length of the thumb, it is Type C. It should be noted that the thumb penetration test is the least accurate testing method. Dry strength test. Take a sample of dry soil. If it crumbles freely or with moderate pressure into individual grains, it is considered granular (Type C). Dry soil that falls into clumps that subsequently break into smaller clumps) and the smaller clumps can only be broke with difficulty) is probably clay in combination with gravel, sand, or silt (Type B). Plasticity or Wet Thread Test. Take a moist sample of soil. Mold it into a ball and then attempt to roll it into a thin thread approximately 1 8 inch in diameter by two (2) inches in length. If the soil sample does not break when held by one end, it might be considered Type B. A pocket penetrometer, shearvane, or torvane may also be used to determine the unconfined compression strength of soils. F. Imminent Danger Work in a trench with vertical walls and a depth exceeding seven feet is considered imminent danger. No employee shall enter a trench with vertical walls unless the trench is in solid rock or unless protection is provided. G. Additional Program Requirements The following subjects relative to trenching and excavations are covered in Appendix A Spoil Piles Crossing Trenches Ingress and Egress Exposure to Vehicles Exposure to Falling Loads Warning Systems for Mobile Equipment Hazardous Atmospheres and Confined Spaces Standing Water and Water Accumulation Benching, Shoring, Sloping and Shielding Requirements Recordkeeping The following records shall be maintained in accordance with Records Retention for Safety, Health and Environmental Compliance (Procedure GS 43) in the Safety Manual.

Inspection, Fueling, Charging, and Maintenance Procedures The following section will review  Pre-Use Inspection Fuel-Handling and Storage Battery Handling and Storage Maintenance Pre-Use Inspection Engine-off Inspection A pre-use inspection identifies potential hazards that may be encountered from a damaged forklift and must be performed at least daily by the operator before operation. If at any time a forklift is found to be in-need of repair, defective, or in any way unsafe, the forklift shall be removed from service until it has been restored to safe operating condition. Always refer to manufacturer provided manuals for appropriate inspections guidance. A forklift does not need to be inspected on any day that it is not used. The pre-use inspection can include the following, however refer to the user   s manual for the type of machine you are using  Verify that the data plate is present, legible, and represents the configuration in use. Verify that all safety and control stickers and labels are present and legible. Verify that all safety equipment is present. Inspect the mast for broken or cracked weld points and any other obvious damage. Ensure roller tracks are greased and that chains are free to travel. Forks should be equally spaced and free from cracks along the blade and at the heels. Check hydraulic fluid levels. Check each hydraulic line and fitting for excessive wear or crimping. Check hydraulic lines for breakage in the outer case or sheath. Check lift and tilt cylinders for damage or leaking fluid. Fluid leaks are not considered normal and must be repaired. Inspect mounting hardware on the cylinders. Check tires for excessive wear, splitting or missing tire material. Check pneumatic tires for proper pressure indicated on the tire. Power Source Inspection Battery Power Batteries contain acid, so protective gloves, goggles, and long sleeves must be worn when working with batteries. Batteries systems should be inspected for  Cracks or holes Securely sealed cells Frayed cables Broken insulation. This can occur when a cord rubs against the forklift casing. Tight connections Clogged vent caps Propane Power Before replacement, all LP-gas containers should be examined by the operator for the following defects or damage  Dents, scrapes, and gouges of the pressure vessel Damage to the various valves and liquid level gauge Debris in the relief valve Damage to or loss of the relief valve cap Indication of leakage at the valves or threaded connections Engine-on Inspection Once the engine off inspection has been completed. Mount the forklift safely, put on your seat belt and make any personal adjustments to the seat and wheel. Start the engine and verify that all controls operate as they should including  lift, tilt, and shift controls, lights, horns, backup alarms etc. The wheel should have appropriate free play. Move forward and brake, ensuring travelling and stopping operates as it should. Check the floor for evidence of fluid leaks. Again, fluid leaks are not normal and must be fixed. Once operational aspects are verified, you may begin work. Fuel Handling and Storage Fuel storage and Liquid fuels such as gasoline and diesel not stored in underground or aboveground storage tanks should be stored in approved safety cans. The engine should be stopped, and the operator should not be on or inside the truck during refueling. A soap solution should be used to check for LPG gas leaks. A match or open flame should not be used. Smoking is prohibited in the container refilling area and in the exchange area during the exchange of containers. Cylinders for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) shall be stored in the following manner  Cylinders in   storage   having   individual   LPG   capacity   greater   than   1-pound   shall   be positioned so that the relief valve is in direct contact with the vapor space of the cylinder. Cylinders not in use shall be protected by one of the following  screw-on-type caps collars closed, plugged, or capped cylinder outlet valves Cylinders stored within buildings shall not be located  near exits, stairwells, or in areas normally intended to be used for the safe egress of occupants near athletic fields, or other areas of public gathering Cylinders stored within buildings frequented by the public shall not exceed an LPG capacity of 1 pound per cylinder, and be limited to a total combined capacity for all cylinders of less than 20 pounds of LPG. Cylinder storage within buildings not frequented by the public shall be limited to a total maximum quantity of no more than 300 pounds of LPG per storage location. Empty cylinders that have been in LPG service shall be considered as if full for the purposes of determining the maximum permissible quantity of LPG cylinders emptied. Cylinders storage locations outside of buildings shall be at least 5 feet from any doorway or openings in a building, or, for buildings with only one means of egress cylinders, be no closer than 10 feet from any doorway or opening  be at least 20 feet from any automotive fuel dispenser  be enclosed with at least a 6-foot high industrial-type fence, chain link fence, or equivalent protection  have at least two means of egress from the enclosure, unless the enclosure is not over 100 square feet in area, the containers are not filled within the enclosure, and the point of transfer is within 3 feet of the gate  and have lighting provided to illuminate storage containers, containers being loaded, control valves, and other equipment if operations are normally conducted during hours other than daylight Battery Handling and Storage Designated Charging Areas Battery charging installations should be located in designated charging areas that provide flushing (eyewashes safety showers) and spill neutralizing materials for spilled electrolyte, fire protection, protection of charging apparatus from damage by trucks, and adequate ventilation for dispersal of battery gassing fumes. Facilities for quick drenching or flushing of the eyes and body (approved emergency eyewash and safety shower) must be provided at or near (within 10 seconds) the charging area. Smoking and   other   ignition   sources   are   prohibited   in   the   charging       No Smoking  signs must be posted. Additional precautions must be taken to prevent open flames, sparks or electric arcs in battery charging areas. Charging Batteries Properly position forklift and apply brake before attempting to change or charge batteries. Rubber gloves must be worn when handling lead acid batteries. Eye or face protection must also be worn when connecting a charger to a battery. Chargers must be turned off when leads are being connected or disconnected. All leads and cables must be checked and in good condition. When moving batteries, vent caps must be kept firmly in place to avoid electrolyte splashing. When charging batteries, ensure vent caps are functioning and the battery (or compartment) cover(s) are open to dissipate heat. When charging is complete, be sure to replace the vent cap firmly. Keep tools and other metallic objects away from the top of uncovered batteries. Properly position and secure reinstalled batteries in the forklift. Reinstalled batteries or new batteries shall be equivalent to, or shall be rated higher than, the battery type indicated on the truck nameplate. Any additional safety requirements or operating procedures specified by the manufacturer of the forklift, battery or charging system must be followed. Maintenance Do not use open flames to check for electrolyte level in batteries or liquid fuel level in tanks Do not conduct repairs to fuel and ignition systems of forklifts in areas where fire hazards exist. Disconnect batteries prior to repairing electrical systems. Follow all lockout tag out procedures related to the release of hazardous energy. Use only replacement parts equivalent with those in the original design. Do not alter the relative positions of various parts from how they were received from the manufacturer. Do not add any parts not supplied by the manufacturer nor delete any parts supplied by the manufacturer. No additional counterweighting of forklifts is permitted unless approved by the manufacturer. Keep forklift mufflers in proper working condition and free of debris. Keep the forklift in clean condition, free of lint, excess oil, and grease. When antifreeze is used in the engine-cooling system, only glycol-based material should be used. Operating Procedures The following section will review  Basic Operating Rules Handling and Moving Loads Forklift Operating Rules and Guidelines There are several rules and best practices for operating a forklift. They can be summarized very briefly with three concepts. Ensure you are aware of the  Forklift   s capabilities and inspection status Workspace conditions Load   s size, stability, and weight distribution More Details Only trained and authorized personnel eighteen (18) years old and older are permitted to operate a forklift. Do not operate a gasoline-powered or diesel-powered forklift in a poorly ventilated area. Carbon monoxide gas, an odorless poisonous gas made by internal combustion engines, can build up. Do not stand or pass under the elevated portion of any forklift. Passengers are prohibited from riding on forklifts. Do not place arms or legs between the uprights of the mast or outside the running lines of the truck. Keep all body parts inside the vehicle. When back do not hold the outer post. Fingers may be easily crushed or sheared off if outside the vehicle during a collision. When mounting or dismounting a forklift  face the vehicle, never jump off, use a three-point stance (always have both hands and one foot or vice-versa in contact with the unit) Wear proper shoes (oil resistant and non-slippery), Wear proper clothing (do not wear loose clothing or dangling jewelry), and restrain long hair. After mounting the vehicle, fasten the seat belt, apply the brake, and shift to neutral. Also, check around the forklift for clearance and pedestrians before moving. When dismounting a forklift you must secure it properly. You must  Fully lower load or empty forks to the floor Place controls in neutral Set the parking brake If you are going to be more than 25 feet away from the vehicle or it will be out of you line of site you must  Shut off power Maintain a safe distance from the edge of ramps or platforms while on any elevated dock or platform. Forklifts are not to be used to open or close freight doors. Forklifts should not be used in areas of poor lighting (less than two lumens per square foot) unless they are equipped with auxiliary directional lighting and the lighting is turned on. Fixed jacks may be necessary to support a semitrailer and prevent upending during the loading or unloading when the trailer is not coupled to a tractor. Set brakes and block wheels with wheel chocks to prevent movement of trucks and trailers while loading or unloading when they are boarded by forklifts. Check the flooring of trucks and trailers for breaks and weakness before loading or unloading. Check for sufficient headroom under overhead hazards such as lights, pipes, or sprinkler systems. Do not lift personnel or allow personnel to be lifted or work from the fork lift without a properly engineered, manufacturer approved, and properly attached lifting carriage. Whenever a truck is equipped with a lifting carriage or forks for lifting personnel, take the following precautions  Ensure the platform is firmly secured to the lifting carriage and or forks Provide means whereby personnel on the platform can shut off power to the truck Provide protection from falling objects Handling and Moving Loads To Pick Up a Load Only pick up stable and safely arranged loads within the rated capacity of the forklift. Adjust long or high (including stacked) loads which may affect capacity. Square up on the center of the load and approach it straight with forks in traveling position. Stop when the tips of the forks are about a foot away from the load. Level the forks and slowly drive forward until the load is resting against the backrest. Lift the load high enough to clear whatever is under it. If lifting from a rack be mindful of the shelving above the load  ensure you do not strike or catch on shelves above. Use a spotter as necessary. If working in and around racks, ensure that other workers will not be at risk of falling objects  consider the risk of pushing objects off the other side of rack (clear aisles of people as necessary). Carefully tilt the mast back to stabilize the load. Driving With a Load Always travel with a load tilted slightly back for added stability. Starts and stops should be gradual  Avoid sudden acceleration or braking. Observe all traffic regulations and keep forklift under control at all times. Reduce speed and sound horn at intersections and other locations where vision is obstructed Keep a clear view of the path of travel. Always look in the direction of travel. Drive in reverse rather than looking around the load if you are unable to see over it. Pedestrians have the right-of-way. Always be aware of their presence especially in aisles and doorways. Never drive a forklift directly towards anyone standing in front of a wall or other fixed object Do not lift or lower the load when the forklift is in motion. Travel with the load at a height of four to six inches at the tips and two inches at the heels to clear most uneven surfaces and avoid debris. Horseplay is not permitted. Slow down for wet, slippery, or uneven floors. Avoid running over loose objects on the roadway surface. Properly secure dock boards and bridge plates before driving over them. Drive over slowly and never exceed their rated capacity. When traveling on a ramp (ascending or descending grades in excess of 10%)  Ascend or descend grades slowly Never turn on a ramp Drive loaded trucks with the load upgrade regardless of the direction of travel Drive empty trucks with the forks downgrade, regardless of the direction of travel Use low gear or the slowest speed when descending a grade. Safe Steering Slow down to maintain balance. Remember that the rear wheels turn. Turns can be made from the centerline of a turn or slightly to the inside. With a front wheel steering car our tendency is to swing wide. On a forklift,    swinging wide    can result in the back end striking any objects, walls, or racks on the outside of the turn. Allow enough room for forks to clear the sides before turning, when backing out of an aisle. When negotiating turns, turn the steering wheel in a smooth sweeping motion. At very low speeds, turn the steering wheel at a moderate, even rate. Never turn a forklift with the load or empty forks lifted higher than the travel height (i.e. four to six inches at the tips and two inches at the heels on flat terrain  a few inches higher may be appropriate on slightly uneven terrain). Placing a Load on an Elevated Surface Square up and stop about a foot away from the rack on which the load is to be placed. Raise the load 5-10 inches above the unloading point (space permitting). Drive forward stopping 3-4 inches in front of deposit point. Tilt mast forward to a right angle position so load is level. Drive forward until load is aligned with the deposit point. Stop. Gently lower load to resting-place. Stack pallets loaded with cases, cartons straight and square. Stagger the top tier to  tie-in place . Tilt the forks slightly forward to avoid hooking the load Look over both shoulders and back straight out until the forks clear the rack. Stop. Once clear lower the forks to about 2-4 inches above the ground, then continue to backup or turn to proceed to the next location. Do not turn with elevated forks. Placing a load on the ground floor Square up the forks, approach the landing place. Level the forks and then drive the rest of the way in. Lower the load. Tilt the forks slightly forward to avoid hooking the load. Look over both shoulders and back straight out until the forks clear the pallet. Training & Evaluation Each powered industrial truck operator must be determined to be competent to operate one safely, as demonstrated by the successful completion of training and evaluation. Employers shall certify that each operator has been trained and evaluated. The certification shall include the name of the operator, the date of the training, the date of the evaluation, and the identity of the person(s) performing the training or evaluation. Certification of training is not a license and there is no such thing as a state issued forklift license. EHS may, at its discretion, implement certification plans that include carrying a record of training (such as a wallet or lanyard card). Training shall consist of a combination of formal instruction (lecture, discussions, interactive computer learning, video, written material, etc.), and practical training (demonstrations performed by the trainer and practical exercises performed by the trainee). Evaluation consists of successful demonstration of the operator   s performance in the workplace and can include interaction and follow-up questions. Operator training and evaluation will be conducted by EHS personnel who have the knowledge, training, and experience to train forklift operators and evaluate their competence. EHS may designate qualified individuals to conduct evaluations of their workers. EHS representatives may audit and evaluate individuals and departments at their discretion. Upon completion of the training program, all operators must be evaluated for performance of proper procedures prior to receipt of an operator certificate. Required Training Topics All powered industrial trucks forklift operators shall receive initial training in the following topics  Operating instruction, warning and precautions for the types of trucks the operator will be authorized to operate. Truck controls and instrumentation Differences between a PIT forklift and an automobile Engine and motor operation Steering and maneuvering Visibility (including restrictions due to loading) Vehicle Capacity Any vehicle inspection and maintenance that the operator will be required to perform Refueling and or changing of batteries Operating limitations, and any workplace related topics (e.g. surface conditions, narrow aisles, pedestrian traffic, and hazardous locations). Refresher training in all the above listed topics, and other relevant topics, will be provided to all powered industrial truck forklift operators  when the operator has been observed to operate the vehicle in an unsafe manner  when the operator has been involved in an accident or near-miss incident  when the operator has received an evaluation that reveals that the operator is not operating the truck safely  when the operator is assigned to drive a different type of truck, or a condition in the workplace changes in a manner that would affect the safe operations of a forklift. Other Training Notes If an operator has previously received training in a topic specified above and such training is appropriate to the truck and working conditions encountered, additional training in that topic is not required if the operator has been evaluated and found competent to operate the truck safely. For example, training on a standup narrow-aisle forklift does not mean a forklift operator is trained on a sit-down LPG forklift, but retraining on all components is not necessary if they are documented in prior training. For this to qualify at UTK, evidence of prior training as well as a record of evaluation conducted here at UTK must be documented. However, each employer must ensure that each powered industrial truck operator is competent to operate a truck safely, as demonstrated by the successful completion of the training and evaluation. As stated above, the OSHA Powered Industrial Trucks standard requires additional training for forklift operators who change and charge batteries  handle propane tanks  fuel diesel or gasoline engines  and repair and maintain powered industrial trucks. Recordkeeping Employers who evaluate the operator s performance more frequently than every three years may retain the most recent certification record. Otherwise, certification records must be maintained for three years. An individual training record shall be maintained for each employee and kept for period of employment + 5 years. The training instructor will document certify the training and evaluation and will include in the documentation the name of the operator, the date of the training, the date of the evaluation, and the identity of the person(s) performing the training or evaluation.

EHS is responsible for  Interpreting crane and hoist safety rules and standards. Revising Crane and Hoist Program. Assist in the investigation of accidents related to cranes. Procedures General Requirements for Cranes, Hoists and Slings  Only trained employees shall operate a crane or hoist. Cranes and hoists shall go through a pre-use, monthly and annual inspection. Any unsafe condition noted during an inspection shall be corrected before the equipment is used. Operators shall comply with the manufacturer s specifications and limitations applicable to the operation of the equipment. Where manufacturer s specifications are not available, the limitations assigned to the equipment shall be based on the determinations of a qualified engineer competent in this field and such determinations will be appropriately documented and recorded. Operators shall follow safe work practices when operating a cranes, hoists and slings. (See Appendix F) Crane and Hoist Operators To be qualified as a Crane and Hoist Operator, the candidate shall have received hands-on training from a licensed, qualified crane and hoist operator designated by the candidate s supervisor.   Crane and Hoist Operators must renew their license every three years. General Safety Rules Operators shall comply with the following rules while operating the cranes and hoists  Do not engage in any practice that will divert your attention while operating the crane. Respond to signals only from the person who is directing the lift, or any appointed signal person. Obey a stop signal at all times, no matter who gives it. Do not move a load over people. People shall not be placed in jeopardy by being under a suspended load. Also, do not work under a suspended load unless the load is supported by blocks, jacks, or a solid footing that will safely support the entire weight. Have a crane or hoist operator remain at the controls or lock open and tag the main electrical disconnect switch. Ensure that the rated load capacity of a crane s bridge, individual hoist, or any sling or fitting is not exceeded. Know the weight of the object being lifted or use a dynamometer or load cell to determine the weight. Check that all controls are in the OFF position before closing the main-line disconnect switch. If spring-loaded reels are provided to lift pendants clear off the work area, ease the pendant up into the stop to prevent damaging the wire. Avoid side pulls. These can cause the hoist rope to slip out of the drum groove, damaging the rope or destabilizing the crane or hoist. To prevent shock loading, avoid sudden stops or starts. Shock loading can occur when a suspended load is accelerated or decelerated, and can overload the crane or hoist. When completing an upward or downward motion, ease the load slowly to a stop. Operation Pre-operational Test At the start of each work shift, operators shall do the following steps before making lifts with any crane or hoist  Test the upper-limit switch. Slowly raise the unloaded hook block until the limit switch trips. Visually inspect the hook, load lines, trolley, and bridge as much as possible from the operator s station  in most instances, this will be the floor of the building. If provided, test the lower-limit switch. Test all direction and speed controls for both bridge and trolley travel. Test all bridge and trolley limit switches, where provided, if operation will bring the equipment in close proximity to the limit switches. Test the pendant emergency stop. Test the hoist brake to verify there is no drift without a load. If provided, test the bridge movement alarm. Lock out and tag for repair any crane or hoist that fails any of the above tests. Moving a Load Center the hook over the load to keep the cables from slipping out of the drum grooves and overlapping, and to prevent the load from swinging when it is lifted. Inspect the drum to verify that the cable is in the grooves. Use a tag line when loads must traverse long distances or must otherwise be controlled. Manila rope may be used for tag lines. Plan and check the travel path to avoid personnel and obstructions. Lift the load only high enough to clear the tallest obstruction in the travel path. Start and stop slowly. Land the load when the move is finished. Choose a safe landing. Never leave suspended loads unattended. In an emergency where the crane or hoist has become inoperative, if a load must be left suspended, barricade and post signs in the surrounding area, under the load, and on all four sides. Lock open and tag the crane or hoist s main electrical disconnect switch. Parking a Crane or Hoist Remove all slings and accessories from the hook. Return the rigging device to the designated storage racks. Raise the hook at least 2.1 m (7 ft.) above the floor. Store the pendant away from aisles and work areas, or raise it at least 2.1 m (7 ft.) above the floor. Place the emergency stop switch (or push button) in the OFF position. Rigging General Rigging Safety Requirements Only select rigging equipment that is in good condition. All rigging equipment shall be inspected annually  defective equipment is to be removed from service and destroyed to prevent inadvertent reuse. The load capacity limits shall be stamped or affixed to all rigging components. Damage to look for includes  Nylon slings with  Abnormal wear. Torn stitching. Broken or cut fibers. Discoloration or deterioration. Wire-rope slings with  Kinking, crushing, bird-caging, or other distortions. Evidence of heat damage. Cracks, deformation, or worn end attachments. Six randomly broken wires in a single rope lay. Three broken wires in one strand of rope. Hooks opened more than 15% at the throat. Hooks twisted sideways more than 10 deg. from the plane of the unbent hook. Alloy steel chain slings with Cracked, bent, or elongated links or components. Cracked hooks. Shackles, eye bolts, turnbuckles, or other components that are damaged or deformed. Rigging a Load Do the following when rigging a load  Determine the weight of the load. Do not guess. Determine the proper size for slings and components. Do not use manila rope for rigging. Make sure that shackle pins and shouldered eye bolts are installed in accordance with the manufacturer s recommendations. Make sure that ordinary (shoulder less) eye bolts are threaded in at least 1.5 times the bolt diameter. Use safety hoist rings (swivel eyes) as a preferred substitute for eye bolts wherever possible. Pad sharp edges to protect slings. Remember that machinery foundations or angle-iron edges may not feel sharp to the touch but could cut into rigging when under several tons of load. Wood, tire rubber, or other pliable materials may be suitable for padding. Do not use slings, eye bolts, shackles, or hooks that have been cut, welded, or brazed. Install wire-rope clips with the base only on the live end and the U-bolt only on the dead end. Follow the manufacturer s recommendations for the spacing for each specific wire size. Determine the center of gravity and balance the load before moving it. Initially lift the load only a few inches to test the rigging and balance. Crane Overloading Cranes or hoists shall not be loaded beyond their rated capacity for normal operations. Any crane or hoist suspected of having been overloaded shall be removed from service by locking open and tagging the main disconnect switch. Additionally, overloaded cranes shall be inspected, repaired, load tested, and approved for use before being returned to service. Working at Heights on Cranes or Hoists Anyone conducting maintenance or repair on cranes or hoists at heights greater than 6 ft. shall use fall protection. Fall protection should also be considered for heights less than 6 ft. Fall protection includes safety harnesses that are fitted with a lifeline and securely attached to a structural member of the crane or building or properly secured safety nets. Use of a crane as a work platform should only be considered when conventional means of reaching an elevated worksite are hazardous or not possible.   Personnel shall not board any bridge crane unless the main disconnect switch is locked and tagged open. Personnel shall not use bridge cranes without a permanent platform (catwalk) as work platforms. Bridge catwalks shall have a permanent ladder access. Personnel shall ride seated on the floor of a permanent platform with approved safety handrails, wear safety harnesses attached to designated anchors, and be in clear view of the crane operator at all times. Operators shall lock and tag open the main (or power) disconnect switch on the bridge catwalk when the crane is parked. Hand Signals Signals to the operator shall be in accordance with the standard hand signals unless voice communications equipment (telephone, radio, or equivalent) is used. Signals shall be discernible or audible at all times. Some special operations may require addition to or modification of the basic signals. For all such cases, these special signals shall be agreed upon and thoroughly understood by both the person giving the signals and the operator, and shall not be in conflict with the standard signals. Inspection, Maintenance, and Testing All tests and inspections shall be conducted in accordance with the manufacturer   s recommendations. If any unsafe conditions exist, the equipment shall be removed from service. In order to remove a crane or hoist from service it shall be locked out and tagged out to prevent use. Cranes and hoists not in regular use A unit which has been idle for a period of one month or more shall be given a monthly inspection before placing in service. Prior to initial use, all new, altered, modified or repaired cranes and hoists shall have the following testing performed by the installation company or third party  Hoisting and lowering Trolley travel Bridge travel Limit switches, locking and safety devices Load Tests shall not be more than 125% of the rated load unless otherwise recommended by the manufacturer. Monthly Tests and Inspections All in-service cranes and hoists shall be inspected monthly and the results documented. Defective cranes and hoists shall be locked and tagged  out of service  until all defects are corrected. Annual Inspections The Department shall schedule and supervise (or perform) annual preventive maintenance (PM) and annual inspections of all cranes and hoists. The annual PM and inspection shall cover  Hoisting and lowering mechanisms. Trolley travel or monorail travel. Bridge travel. Limit switches and locking and safety devices. Structural members. Bolts or rivets. Sheaves and drums. Parts such as pins, bearings, shafts, gears, rollers, locking devices, and clamping devices. Brake system parts, linings, pawls, and ratchets.

Electrical apparatus such as controller contractors, limit switches, and push button stations. Wire rope. Hoist chains. Load Testing Newly installed cranes and hoists shall be load tested at 125% of the rated capacity by designated personnel. Slings shall have appropriate test data when purchased. It is the responsibility of the purchaser to ensure that the appropriate test data are obtained and maintained. Re-rated cranes and hoists shall be load tested to 125% of the new capacity if the new rating is greater than the previous rated capacity. Fixed cranes or hoists that have had major modifications or repair shall be load tested to 125% of the rated capacity. Cranes and hoists that have been overloaded shall be inspected prior to being returned to service. Personnel platforms, baskets, and rigging suspended from a crane or hoist hook shall be load tested initially, then re-tested annually thereafter or at each new job site. All cranes and hoists with a capacity greater than 2722 kg (3 tons) should be load tested every four years to 125% of the rated capacity. Cranes and hoists with a lesser capacity should be load tested every eight years to 125% of the rated capacity. All mobile hoists shall be load tested at intervals to be determined. Recordkeeping Training Records  Retain Qualifications and Training records for Operators and Stand-by Persons at least ten years after the person has retired or left University employment. Equipment Inspections  Retain any written evidence of daily pre-use inspections for the last year. Retain    Quarterly Inspections    for the last three years. For Crane Hoist and rigging, initial load tests for less than three ton rated cranes, and quadrennial load tests for over three ton rated cranes, tests for all cranes and    job-made    rigging, retain records for the life of the crane or hoist. Record Retention Requirements Retain indefinitely records of annual shop inspections that include cranes or hoists. Retain indefinitely records of training. Retain indefinitely copies of load testing and load rating reduction tests until equipment is dismantled or destroyed. Training and Information Qualified Crane Operators receive documented training on the operation of the Crane Hoist and associated rigging they use before they are allowed to use the equipment. A    Qualified Person Operator    may train a Stand-by Person for a specific and designated lift as long as the Operator discusses all safe-lift aspects and known hazards concerning the lift with the Stand-by Person, and coordinates their lift rigging planning, prior to conducting the lift. The Department owning the crane or hoist has the option of providing training through  A training provider outside the University. Training within the department by a    Qualified Person   . Training must be completed prior to any use of a crane or hoist. Training of crane and hoist operators should consist of classroom instruction & hands-on training. Classroom instruction, hands-on training and operator evaluations can be conducted by either a competent trainer in the work unit, the equipment manufacturer, a safety consultant and or a vendor who specializes in crane hoist training. Hands-on training and hands-on evaluation portions of the training can also be conducted by an employee in the department work unit who is experienced and competent with the equipment. This person could be a trained operator, supervisor manager, or safety officer. Training must be specific to the type of equipment being used. Training shall include the following  Characteristics of safe crane and hoist operation  Inspection procedures  Basic load handling considerations  Operator responsibilities  Communication used during crane and hoist operation  Hands-on equipment training.

Effective Date  11 01 2016 Revision Date  11 01 2016 jump to appendices and forms   highlight  Purpose The purpose of this guidance document is to outline the hazards associated with silica dust and outline the steps to take to ensure employees who work around silica are not exposed to hazardous levels of silica dust. Scope and Applicability This shall apply to all students, staff, faculty and students on the University of Tennessee Knoxville campus who are expected to be exposed to silica dust. Crystalline silica is a basic component of soil, sand, granite and many other minerals. Quartz is the most common form of crystalline silica.   All materials containing silica can result in the presence of respirable silica particles when chipping, cutting, drilling or grinding takes place. Silica exposure occurs through inhalation of silica containing particles and occurs through many construction and general industry methods.     The most severe exposures generally occur during abrasive blasting with sand to remove paint and rust from bridges, tanks, concrete structures and other surfaces.   Other activities that may result in sever silica exposure include jack hammering, rock well drilling, concrete mixing, concrete drilling, brick and concrete cutting sawing, tuck pointing and tunneling operations.   Exposure to excessive silica dust over long periods of time can result in silicosis. Abbreviations and Definitions Abbreviations EHS  Environmental Health and Safety EPA     Environmental Protection Agency OSHA  Occupational Safety and Health Administration Definitions Authorized person  An employee who has received proper training and exposure monitoring to safely work with silica containing materials. Action Limit  A concentration of airborne respirable crystalline silica 25   g m3, calculated as an 8-hour, time weighted average. Crystalline silica  Naturally occurring component in earth soils, sand, granite and many other minerals resulting in many building materials containing silica. Exposure Assessment  The initial determination to find if any employee may be exposed to silica at or above the permissible exposure level. Until the assessment is completed, employees shall take all precautions necessary to maintain exposures below the PEL. HEPA (High Efficiency Particulate Air)  A filtering system capable of trapping and retaining at least 99.97% of all particles of 0.3 micron in diameter and larger. Permissible Exposure Limit  (PEL)  the OSHA limit for silica dust exposure.   It is set at 50  g m3, averaged over an 8-hour workday, as a time weighted average. Silica containing material  Any material, which has the potential to contain silica at levels, which may pose a hazard to employees when the material is manipulated to create airborne particles Silicosis  A lung disease caused by inhalation of silica dust.     Silica dust can cause fluid buildup and scar tissue in the lungs that cuts down the ability for the lungs to fully function. The disease is not curable, but can be prevented through the use of protective systems. Roles and Responsibilities Environmental Health & Safety Environmental Health & Safety (EHS) provides program oversight and consultation to UTK work groups regarding potential risks, exposure prevention and training relating to silica dust exposures. Conduct building material assessments for silica containing materials and perform employee silica hazard assessments monitoring upon request. UTK Departments Each department with responsibilities for maintaining buildings or working in buildings with potential exposure to silica should  Ensure the applicable components of the Silica Dust Safety Program are available to all affected employees. Provide applicable training to employees expected to work in, or with, building materials where there is a potential risk for silica exposure. Supervisors UTK employees who supervise personnel with responsibilities to work in areas where there is a risk of exposure to silica dust, must ensure employees are properly trained on the applicable contents of the Silica Dust Safety Program and are provided appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) when conducting such work. Authorized Person  Employees working in areas where there is an identified risk of silica dust exposure must be properly trained on all applicable elements of the UTK Silica Dust Safety Program  and be provided and utilize the appropriate PPE for the task being performed. Procedures Material Assessment Any time there is a potential for silica containing materials to be involved in a project, sources of silica must be assessed prior to disturbing. EHS or an authorized contractor can perform building material assessments to determine silica content in materials. Crystalline silica occurs naturally in the earth   s crust and is a basic component of sand, concrete, brick, asphalt, granite, some blasting grit and wall spackling materials. Employees can be exposed to silica when conducting activities such as  Abrasive blasting Jack hammering Concrete crushing Hoe ramming Rock drilling Mixing of concrete or grout Concrete drilling Sawing concrete or bricks Chipping or scarifying concrete Rock crushing Moving or dumping piles of concrete, rock or sand Demolition of concrete or brick Using coatings containing silica Removing coatings containing silica If airborne silica is expected to be generated during the project, EHS shall be contacted to conduct exposure monitoring and ensure all safety precautions are followed to minimize exposure to airborne silica dust. Exposure Monitoring Initial Exposure Monitoring  UTK employees expected to come in contact work with silica containing materials where there is a risk of exposure through inhalation of dust should develop an exposure monitoring program. Initial exposure monitoring should be conducted by EHS to quantitatively evaluate the exposure to airborne silica. Exposure monitoring should be conducted on any employee exposed to airborne silica dust as levels may vary based on job duty within a project. For example, the employee performing concrete cutting vs an employee providing supervision during the work. Periodic Exposure Monitoring  Whenever silica exposure levels are greater than, or equal to the Action Limit (25   g m3), periodic exposure monitoring is required. It is the responsibility of the affected department to work with EHS and develop a periodic exposure monitoring schedule. The frequency of exposure monitoring should be as follows  Measured Concentration  Monitoring Frequency  Permissible Exposure Level     50   g m3            Annual Exposure monitoring is not required by every employee at risk of airborne silica exposure. Enough sampling must be done to enable the employee   s exposure level to be reasonably represented. Termination of Exposure Monitoring  Periodic exposure monitoring may be discontinued if results from two consecutive sampling periods taken at least 7 days apart show that employee exposure is below the Action Level. Sampling methods Personal exposure monitoring will be conducted using an approved NIOSH or OSHA methods. Monitoring records shall include the following. The date, number, duration, location and results of each of the samples taken, including a description of the sampling procedure used to determine representative employee exposure where applicable. A description of the sampling and analytical methods used. The type of respiratory protective devices, if any. Name and job classification of the employee monitored. Any environmental variables that could affect the measurement of the employee exposure. Reporting of exposure monitoring results EHS will notify the department supervisor of exposure monitoring results within as soon as the final laboratory analysis is completed. The department supervisor must provide this information to the affected employee(s) within 5 working days. If levels are measured during the exposure monitoring exceeding the Action Level, the EHS report will include steps and controls to reduce exposure to below the Action Level. Follow up exposure monitoring may be necessary if engineering or administrative controls are put in place to reduce hazardous exposures. Exposure Control Pre-project planning Prior to projects taking place affecting UTK buildings facilities, EHS reviews planning documents to account for potential exposures to hazardous materials, including silica. EHS can conduct building material assessments to make determinations if there are any silica containing materials, which may be impacted by the project. During the planning process, any silica containing materials are addressed and methods for exposure control are provided prior to work beginning. If silica containing materials are to be disturbed during the project, the appropriate exposure control methods will be recommended by EHS. Administrative Engineering Controls Where silica exposures at or above the Permissible Exposure Limit have been documented, or are expected, the appropriate engineering or administrative controls will be implemented, where feasible. Follow-up exposure monitoring may be necessary when administrative or engineering exposure controls are utilized. Typical controls may involve  Substituting non-silica containing materials for use while abrasive blasting Alternative methods such as pre ordering grout already mixed instead of on- site mixing in bulk Local exhaust ventilation General ventilation Vacuum methods with HEPA filters Distance Dust control products Containment Use of water to keep dust down General work practices such as good housekeeping, worker rotation, development of specific SOPs to minimize exposure Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) In addition to administrative engineering controls, employees may be required to wear specific PPE during the disturbance of silica containing materials and or when airborne silica is present. The level of protection will depend on the task being conducted and the tools being utilized to complete the task. Recommended PPE will typically include  Respiratory Protection Disposable or reusable work clothing to keep from spreading the dust or bringing the dust home Leather gloves Safety glasses or goggles Face shield Boot covers or rubber boots The following table provides recommended respiratory protection levels based on the measured or anticipated exposure levels  Respirator Protection Factor Typical Silica Activity N95 Less than 50   g m3                 Used on voluntary basis to control low exposures Half-face with HEPA filters (N-100) 50    500   g m3                 Housekeeping (wet method)                 Saw cutting (wet method)                 Drilling concrete (wet method)                 Power tools with dust collection                 Equipment operating with open cab Full-face with HEPA filters 500     5,000   g m3                 Chipping concrete                 Jack Hammering                 Power tools without dust collection                 Mixing grout in bulk                 Vacuum abrasive blasting SCBA or Supplied Air Above 5,000   g m3                 - Abrasive blasting Housekeeping & Hygiene Facilities In areas where silica containing dust may be present, all surfaces must be maintained free from accumulations of dust to minimize potential silica exposure. Dust and other silica containing debris must be removed from the work area as soon as possible. Acceptable method of silica dust removal includes the use of HEPA vacuum or wet methods such as wet mopping. Unacceptable methods of silica dust removal include dry sweeping, vacuum cleaners, shop vacuums, and compressed air. Follow all recommended procedures and utilize recommended PPE during silica containing debris cleanup activities. Where silica containing materials are used, impacted, or being removed  the following requirements must be met. PPE should be removed upon work completion and disposed of after each use. Employees must wash hands and are recommended to shower prior to leaving work. Ensure contaminated PPE, including footwear is not worn outside the work areas. Medical Surveillance Employees exposed to silica levels above the OSHA Action Level of 25   g m3to the Permissible Exposure Limit (50   g m3) and above for 30 or more days per year, or any employee working with silica who develops signs symptoms of excessive exposure, should be enrolled in the Medical Surveillance Program. Medical surveillance is also required for individuals who use a respirator for 30 days per year or more to control exposure to silica. All medical surveillance will be performed by UT Occupational Health and results must be provided the affected employee and their supervisor within 15 days of the assessment. The medical surveillance program consists of baseline examination and chest X-ray. Employees enrolled in the medical surveillance program should be examined annually to track any changes as a result to exposure to silica dust. Training and Recordkeeping Hazard Communication training is required by all UTK employees and should be conducted initially upon hiring. Additional information can be found at ehs.utk.edu Silica Awareness Training is available in person or at ehs.utk.edu. And must be offered to affected employees prior to working with silica and annually thereafter. Silica awareness training should include the following  Information about the potential health effects and symptoms of exposure to respirable silica Safety data sheets for silica, quartz, and applicable products containing silica The purpose and set up of regulated areas to mark the boundaries of work areas containing silica dust The use of engineering controls, work practices, good housekeeping and PPE to control exposure to silica Use and care of PPE Expected exposures to silica dust Exposure monitoring process Medical surveillance process Respiratory protection training, medical clearance, and quantitative fit testing is required under the Respiratory Protection Program. Contact EHS for additional information regarding enrollment in the program. The supervisor is required to maintain all training, medical surveillance, and exposure monitoring results.

While the materials used to manufacture a plastic bottle may have hazards, once it becomes a bottle, it is an    article   . Hazardous substance  Any substance that is capable of causing an acute or chronic health condition in humans or adversely impacting the environment. Substances that are considered physical hazards (flammable substances, explosives, shock sensitive, etc.) are included in the definition of a hazardous substance. The OSHA Hazard Communication Standard, 29 CFR 1910.1200 and the OSHA Chemical Hygiene Plan 29 CFR 1910.1450 are the two main standards that define a hazardous substance. Employee  A worker who may be exposed to hazardous chemicals under normal operating conditions, or in foreseeable emergencies. Employer  A person engaged in a business where chemicals are either used, distributed, or are produced for use or distribution, including a contractor or subcontractor. Global Harmonization System  developed by the United Nations as an international standardized approach to hazard communications. This ensures that chemical hazard communication is consistent on a global scale. It is commonly referred to as GHS. Laboratory Use     Laboratory use of hazardous chemicals    means handling or use of such chemicals in which all of the following conditions are met  Chemical manipulations are carried out on a    laboratory scale    (i.e., work with substances in which the containers used for reactions, transfers, and other handling of substances is designed to be easily handled by one person)  Multiple chemical procedures or chemicals are used  The procedures involved are not part of a production process, nor do they in any way simulate a production process  and    Protective laboratory practices and equipment    are available and in common use to minimize the potential for worker exposure to hazardous chemicals. Safety data sheet (SDS)  Formally known as Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS)  Detailed information bulletin prepared by the manufacturer or importer of a chemical that describes the physical and chemical properties, physical and health hazards, routes of exposure, precautions for safe handling and use, emergency and first aid procedures, and control measures. Regulatory Basis Hazard Communication Standard (HCS) In 1983, OSHA adopted the Hazard Communication Standard. The Hazard Communication standard is often called the    Right-to-Know    law, or HazCom. Under the HazCom standard, all employees have a right and a need to know  What chemicals you are exposed to The hazards of working with these chemicals What steps employees can take to protect themselves and those they work with Integration of the Globally Harmonized System of Hazard Communication (GHS)  In March 2012, OSHA integrated components of the GHS with the existing Hazard Communication Standard (HCS). The GHS standard was developed by the United Nations and is already used in several countries around the world. OSHA incorporated portions of the GHS into the HazCom standard so that container labeling, SDS (formally MSDS) content and format, and chemical hazard determinations are standardized and consistent from workplace to workplace. Components of HazCom (1910.1200) There are five components of the HazCom standard (1910.1200) that UTK must comply. Written program Chemical inventory Labeling Safety Data Sheets Training These components are detailed in the Procedures section below. Roles and Responsibilities Chemical Users (employees) shall  Be trained before they work with, use, or handle hazardous chemicals upon initial employment and when new hazardous chemicals are introduced. Refresher training shall be conducted annually and documented appropriately for all employees. Stay informed about the hazards of any chemicals known to be present in their workplace, and work with those chemicals in a safe manner. Know how to protect themselves from adverse effects of chemicals. Ensure all containers are properly labeled. Notify their supervisor as soon as possible after exposure to a hazardous chemical in the workplace. Chemical Users in Laboratories shall  Follow the plans and procedures outlined in the Chemical Hygiene Plan Program. Laboratory workers are expected to receive basic training and information on this program via their general lab safety training. Responsible Units (e.g. Departments  Department Heads, Directors) whose employees use hazardous chemicals under their control shall  Ensure their non-laboratory employees are trained on the Hazardous Right-to-Know Standard, and the UTK Hazard Communication procedure and that they post adequate notification informing the employees of their rights under the TOSHA Hazardous Right-to-Know Law by providing a copy of the    You Have a Right to a Safe and Healthful Workplace    TOSHA poster. Ensure their laboratory employees are trained on the Occupational Exposure to Hazardous Chemicals in the laboratory standard and the UTK Hazard Communication program. Determine the required personal protective equipment needed in their work area and ensure their employees are properly trained in the use of that equipment. Ensure that the proper PPE is made available to their employees. Assure that all hazardous chemicals that enter or leave the workplace are properly labeled, tagged, or marked in a manner which complies with the Hazardous Right-to- Know Law, and does not conflict with any other regulation pertaining to hazardous materials. Develop safe procedures for work in their areas, as well as written procedures for emergencies. Ensure that a procedure exists to review and update label information. Ensure that a current chemical listing (inventory) is maintained according to the UTK Chemical Inventory program. Ensure all employees have access to Safety Data Sheets and are informed of any hazards related to chemicals they will use in their work space. This can be done by either hard copies, or via an electronic format, as long as the employees are properly informed and trained to access them. They must be an assurance that they can operate the system and they have access to the SDS at all times. Ensure that any students, contractors, sub-contractors, vendors, salesperson(s), or visitors are informed of any hazardous chemicals used in the areas being visited, or where a person will be working. These people will be provided, or required to provide personal protective equipment for their safety. At least once per year, the employer will forward a statement to EHS certifying that all applicable employees have been properly trained, and will maintain all training records for at least 30 years. Ensure that EHS is receiving hard copies of SDS for any new chemicals ordered in their work area. Make sure that specific training is provided for non-routine tasks. Deal with employee exposure to hazards immediately and take steps as necessary to provide medical evaluation, monitoring, or treatment. Ensure that all employees have been trained on the new GHS standards that OSHA has incorporated into the Hazard Communication Standard by December 2013. EHS shall  Serve as a technical resource for questions and comments regarding the Hazard Communication standard. Coordinate, audit, and determine compliance of UTK   s Hazard Communication Program. Maintain a backup library of hardcopy Safety Data Sheets and provide ready access to SDS during an emergency (accidental release). Provide the fire chief with a copy of the chemical inventory, SDS, and the names and phone numbers of the representatives who can be contacted for information during an emergency situation involving hazardous chemicals. Submit necessary reports to regulatory agencies. Provide Hazard Communication training opportunities to campus. Revise the UTK campus written hazard communication program as necessary. Manage the campus chemical inventory. Visitors shall  Be provided, or required to provide safety and personal protective equipment for their use. Notify UTK of the hazards of any chemicals they are delivering or using while on campus. Disclose health hazards and fire protection information for any trade secrets, which will be protected. Comply with OSHA   s Hazard Communication Standard and with UTK   s hazard communication program. Procedures Below is a description of each of the five hazard communication components and the changes to these categories due to GHS. Written Program UTK   s written Hazard Communication program covers how the HazCom program will be implemented at UTK. This program assures that all aspects of HazCom have been addressed. UT Knoxville   s written Hazard Communications plan can be found on the EHS web-site at  www.ehs.utk.edu , or by contacting EHS at 865-974-5084. All responsible units, where laboratory chemical use occurs, are required to maintain an up-to-date Chemical Hygiene Plan, which should include a comprehensive set of basic rules and procedures for the safe use of hazardous chemicals established and documented for their specific work area. See the Chemical Hygiene Plans document in the Safety Manual for more information. Chemical Inventory An electronic or paper copy of a chemical inventory of each hazard chemical normally used or stored in the workplace must be compiled and maintained. UTK compiles their chemical inventory on the EHS web-site at http   www.pp.utk.edu ChemInv , and EHS has a procedure for maintaining the chemical inventory on this web-site (Chemical Inventory Procedure). The inventory must be updated at least annually and anytime revised information is made available and the currency of the information will be checked at a minimum of once year. All employees who are using or exposed to any hazardous chemicals on the inventory must have access to the inventory. The inventory must include both containerized and non-containerized hazardous substances (i.e. dusts, exhaust fumes, etc.). If the chemical is not hazardous, then it should not be included in the chemical inventory. Please refer to UTK   s procedure on chemical inventories for more information. Labels OSHA   s HazCom standard requires that hazard warning labels must be placed on every container of hazardous chemicals in the workplace. Labels must be legible, in English, and prominently displayed. All containers containing hazardous materials must be properly labeled or marked with the following required information  Manufacturer Labels Product Identifier  name or number used on the label and the SDS. It can be a chemical name, a product name, or some other identifier that helps locate the SDS quickly. Signal Word  used to alert the user to a potential hazard and is determined by the hazard class and category of the chemical. There are two signal words used  Danger-more severe hazards Warning-less severe hazards Hazard Statements  standardized phrases assigned to a specific hazard class and category. They are used to describe the nature and the degree of hazard. Examples include     causes serious eye damage    and    fatal if swallowed   . Precautionary Statements  standardized phrases assigned to a specific hazard class and category. There are four types of precautionary statements, covering prevention, response in case of accidental spills and exposure, storage and disposal. Examples include     wear protective gloves protective clothing    and    store locked up   . Supplier Information  refers to the name, address and telephone number of the chemical manufacturer, importer, or other responsible party. Pictograms  a symbol on a white background with a red border that conveys specific information about the hazards of a chemical. There are a total of nine pictograms   caption id= attachment_1116  align= alignnone  width= 900   This image displays the six key elements of a GHS compliant primary chemical label.

There are a total of nine pictograms   caption  Departments receiving containers without appropriate form of warning should take action to have the material returned or obtain a label from the manufacturer, importer or purchase a label. Portable or Secondary Container Labels Portable or secondary containers do not have to be labeled if it is intended only for immediate use (on that shift), will be used up by the employee who transfers the chemical from one container to another container, and the container remains in his her custody at all times. If all three criteria are not met, the container must be appropriately labeled. A portable or secondary container label must have two parts  The identity of the chemical Some indication of the hazard Labels must be cross- referenced with the SDS and the chemical inventory entry, and must be written in English. They must be placed on a prominent area of the container. Employers can label the container in another language, but the information must be presented in English as well. EHS recommends the use of GHS labels on secondary containers, but this is not a requirement, as long as the required information present. Regardless of the type of labeling system selected, the employer must ensure that employees are fully aware of the hazards and understand the labeling system. Other labeling and signage Other labeling and signage may be required to communicate hazards in work areas, such as NFPA 704 diamonds or laboratory door placards (EHS Lab Door Placard policy LS-010 for more information). Hazard Communication Pictograms The following pictograms are used in manufacturer importer labels and can be used to support secondary container labeling (i.e. indication of hazard).

If there is difficulty in obtaining an SDS, the requestor must contact the supplier and or manufacturer for the SDS. The department head must request the SDS in writing from the manufacturer or distributor within (5) business days. If the SDS is not made available, the employee has a right to refuse to work with that hazardous chemical without retaliation. A person in the work area should be designated as the responsible person to ensure there are copies of SDS for every chemical used and stored in the workspace. The policy of UTK is to maintain a file of Safety Data Sheets (SDSs) in each work unit that corresponds to the inventory of hazardous chemicals in that respective work area. SDSs may be maintained in a notebook, or electronically as long as the method is reliable, readily accessible, workers are properly trained in the use of those systems, and there is an adequate backup system. A master file of all data sheets will be maintained in the files of EHS. This master file of SDSs will be made available upon request during normal working hours, 8 00am to 5 00pm, M-F, by calling 974-5084. During an emergency situation and at times other than normal working hours, individuals can contact the University Police Department at 974-3111 who will have available a current listing of organizations capable of providing emergency management assistance and information. The Safety Data Sheets are designed to provide information concerning the physical and health hazards of chemicals found in the workplace. OSHA now requires that all SDSs must follow a specified 16-section format. An SDS is composed of the following sections, which should be covered in employee training  Identification Hazard(s) identification Composition information on ingredients First-aid measures Fire-fighting measures Accidental release measures Handling and Storage Exposure controls personal protection Physical and chemical properties Stability and reactivity Toxicological information Ecological information Disposal considerations Transport information Regulatory information Other information Training and Information EHS shall provide information to chemical users about this program, including deadlines and format for submittal. Each person who handles or uses hazardous chemicals shall be trained before they work with, use, or handle hazardous chemicals Upon initial employment and When new hazardous chemicals are introduced Refresher training shall be conducted annually and documented appropriately for all employees. All training must be documented by the supervisor. Required training topics (for non-laboratory workers) Hazard Communication Standard Defining the hazard communication standard, the reasons why the standard was written, and the employees    rights under the standard. Written Program (this document) Explanation of the existence of the written plan and how each employee has a right to review the document Chemical Inventory Explanation of the requirement for conducting periodic chemical inventories. Chemical Container Labeling Primary Container requirements (Manufacturer Importer label Product Identifier, Pictograms Signal Words Hazard Statements Precautionary Statements Manufacturer Contact information Secondary Container requirements (those containers in which a worker may use or dispense chemicals) Product identity Some indication of the hazards Safety Data Sheets (SDS) Explanation of the requirement that a Safety Data Sheet (SDS) be procured for each hazardous chemical. Advising where the sheets are kept in the unit and exactly how an employee can arrange to review the sheets. An orientation relative to the information available from the SDS. TOSHA Inspections Questions A discussion of the types of questions to which a properly trained employee should be able to effectively respond. TOSHA will expect employees to verbally recall answers to the following questions in simple language  What are the requirements of the hazard communication standard? What hazardous chemical(s) are you exposed to, or may be exposed to, during normal use or in a foreseeable emergency? Where is this chemical present? What are the short and long term effects on the body, as well as the simple asphyxiant, combustible dust, and pyrophoric gas hazards of the chemical? How can you detect if you are overexposed to the chemical(s)? How can you protect yourself from overexposure? Where are the SDS, chemical list, and written program located? What information must be on the label on containers of hazardous chemicals? What do the pictograms indicate? Employees with potential for exposure to hazardous chemicals shall receive job-specific training in addition to that previously listed including  Special emphasis on chemicals listed as carcinogenic. Methods observations used to detect the presence or release of hazardous chemicals. Procedures, techniques and protective equipment to prevent exposure. The training format selected to present the orientation and review sessions will be selected such that maximum effectiveness of communication is achieved. Depending on the evaluation of the comprehension capability of the group to be trained, an appropriate combination of training modes to include audiovisuals, classroom instruction, small group discussion, one on one individualized instruction, on-the-job demonstrations, etc. will be employed. Specific training for non-routine tasks will be dictated by the situation and evaluated thoroughly in accordance with past experience and knowledge of that situation. Required training topics (for Laboratory Workers) Laboratory workers do not directly relate to the Hazard Communication Standard for laboratory use of chemicals. The method for training workers in the laboratory use of hazardous chemicals is via a different path. This path includes general hazard communication knowledge and skills through General Lab Safety training and specifically via regular and ongoing training and familiarization with the practices outlined in their respective Chemical Hygiene Plans. General UTK does require General Lab Safety Training for all who work in labs (See the Laboratory Health & Safety Policy  LS-001). If researchers work with hazardous chemicals, then training on the five essential components of the hazard communication program is required. They include  Written program Chemical inventory Labeling Safety Data Sheets Training This shall also include training on the concepts of the Globally Harmonized Standard (GHS) as adopted in the Hazard Communication Standard (HCS). Safety Data Sheets Label requirements GHS Pictograms Specific Training on their lab-specific Chemical Hygiene Plans (see the Chemical Hygiene Plan document for details). Recordkeeping Starting in 2008 the University   s central archived chemical inventories shall be kept for at least 30 years. These records may be kept in electronic or hard copy form. Material safety data sheets must be kept indefinitely. An individual training record shall be maintained for each employee and kept for period of employment + 5 years. This should contain  List of each chemical used or handled by the employee. Date of training on hazardous chemicals. A signature of the employee showing training on each chemical used or handled by that employee.

BBP are transmitted through contact with infected human blood and other body fluids such as trauma fluids (synovial fluid, pleural fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, amniotic fluid, etc), semen, etc., and can also be transmitted through the mucous membranes of the eye, nose and mouth, and through any damaged or broken skin (i.e. cuts, scrapes, rashes, acne). Contaminated  presence, or the reasonably anticipated presence, of blood, or other potentially infectious materials on any item or surface Occupational exposure  reasonably anticipated (includes the potential for contact as well as actual contact with blood or OPIM) skin, eye, mucous membrane, non-intact skin, or parenteral contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials that may result from the performance of an employee   s duties. Other potentially infectious materials (OPIM)  Materials in addition to human blood that may be capable of transmitting bloodborne pathogens.   These include  The following human body fluids  semen, vaginal secretions, cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, pleural fluid, pericardial fluid, peritoneal fluid, amniotic fluid, saliva in dental settings, any body fluid that is visibly contaminated with blood, and all body fluids in situations where it is difficult or impossible to differentiate between body fluids. Any unfixed tissue or organ (other than intact skin) from a human (living or dead). HIV-containing cell or tissue cultures, organ cultures, and HIV or HBV-containing culture media or other solutions. Human cell tissue organ cultures not shown to be free of bloodborne pathogens. Blood, organs, or other tissues from experimental animals infected with human bloodborne pathogens. Personal protective equipment (PPE)  specialized clothing or equipment worn by an employee for protection against a hazard. General work clothes (e.g. uniforms, pants, shirts, blouses) not intended to function as protection against a hazard are not considered personal protective equipment. Regulated biohazardous waste  includes any liquid or semi-liquid blood or other potentially infectious materials  contaminated items that could release blood or other potentially infectious materials in a liquid or semi-liquid state if compressed, and or items that are caked with dried blood or other potentially infectious materials. Universal precautions  approach to infection control that assumes all bodily fluids are potentially infectious materials. Work practice controls  controls that reduce the likelihood of exposure by altering the manner in which a task is performed. Roles and Responsibilities This section briefly describes the function of each group and its role in ensuring compliance with the University   s Bloodborne Pathogens Program University Administration The Chancellor of the University is responsible for the administration of this program pertaining to institutional safety and health-related matters. The Chancellor oversees the administration of safety policies through the chain of authority within the institution, delegating to deans, department heads, principal investigators and supervisors the responsibility for ensuring safe work practices of those under their supervision and adherence to established policies, programs and guidelines. EHS EHS is responsible for supporting non-research departments    compliance with this program. Note that employees who work in a research settings must follow the Bloodborne Pathogens Exposure Control Plan that is written and enforced by the Office of Biosafety. Specific duties of the EHS include  Revise this program on an annual basis. Design and improve disposal procedures for biological waste generated in non-research departments. Schedule and co-ordinate the activities of the biohazardous waste contractors on campus. Provide BBP training for all non-research departments upon request. Supervisors The classroom instructor or supervisor has the direct responsibility for assuring that this program established herein are followed by all personnel under their jurisdiction, and that they have an Exposure Control Plan in place that is readily accessible to their employees and students. Affected Employees The individual employees are expected to  Package, label and dispose of all biological waste in accordance with established procedures set forth in this program. Follow the guidelines set in this program document when encountering situations in which a potential exists for BBP exposure and understanding which tasks have potential occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens. Report to their supervisor all possible occupational exposure incidents. Seek the advice, when necessary, of EHS concerning the proper handling and disposal of biological materials. Attend the bloodborne pathogens initial training session and annual retraining sessions. Develop and maintain good personal hygiene habits. Procedures This program covers an individual   s potential exposure to a regulated BBP waste, which includes  Any liquid or semi-liquid blood or other potentially infectious materials (OPIM). Contaminated items that would release blood or OPIM in a liquid or semi-liquid state if compressed. Items that are caked with dried blood or OPIM. A BBP occupational exposure incident occurs when human blood or other bodily fluids enters the bloodstream through  Splash to the eyes, nose, or mouth Puncture wound with contaminated item Contact with broken skin Work Practice Controls Work practice controls should be in place so that individuals can minimize their exposure to BBP. General Guidelines Individuals working in a potentially exposed area where there is a likelihood of exposure, should never eat, drink, smoke, apply cosmetics or lip balm, or handle contact lenses. Do not keep food or drink in refrigerators, freezers, shelves, cabinets, or on counter tops where human blood or OPIM are present. Hand washing is one of the most important (and easiest) practices used to prevent transmission of BBP. An employee should use soap to wash hands, or other exposed skin thoroughly as soon as possible following an exposure. All employees should be familiar with the location of the nearest hand washing facilities. Laboratory sinks, public restrooms, janitor closets, and so forth may be used for hand washing if they are normally supplied with soap. An alcohol-based hand rub may be used in areas without hand washing facilities. If these alternative methods are used, hands should be washed with soap and running water as soon as feasible. Employees who have routine exposure to bloodborne pathogens (such as doctors, nurses, first aid responders, etc) shall be offered the Hepatitis B vaccine series at no cost to them unless  they have previously received the vaccine series  antibody testing has revealed they are immune, or the vaccine is contraindicated for medical reasons. The vaccine is a series of three shots, which gradually builds the body   s immunity to the Hepatitis B virus. The vaccine must be administered within 10 days of job assignment. Employers should create a schedule for periodic cleaning and appropriate disinfecting to ensure the workplace is kept clean and sanitary. Contaminated laundry should be placed and transported in properly labeled biohazard or color- coded bags and containers. Sharps Management Needles  The following universal precautions should be used when encountering used needles  Needles or other sharps should not be bent, recapped, or moved except by using a mechanical device or tool such as forceps, pliers, or broom and dust pan. Needles should never be broken or sheared. Needles shall be disposed of in labeled sharps containers only. Sharps containers shall be closable, puncture-resistant, leak-proof on sides and bottom, and or must be labeled or color-coded. When sharps containers are being moved from the area of use, the containers should be closed immediately before removal or replacement to prevent spillage or protrusion of contents during handling or transport. Sharps containers must be removed from service when they are two-thirds full. Broken Glassware Broken glassware that has been visibly contaminated with blood or OPIM must be sterilized with an approved disinfectant solution before it is disturbed or cleaned up. Broken glassware should not be touched by hand. Sweep or brush the material into a dustpan. Glassware that has been decontaminated may be disposed of in an appropriate sharps container  (i.e. closable, puncture-resistant, leak-proof on sides and bottom, with appropriate biohazard labels). Uncontaminated broken glassware may be disposed of in a closable, puncture-resistant container such as a cardboard box or coffee can. Personal Protective Equipment Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) must be chosen based on the level of protection required for the expected exposure. PPE may include gloves, gowns, lab coats, face shields, masks, eye protection and other gear. The PPE must be readily accessible to the individuals and in appropriate sizes. All PPE must be removed prior to leaving the work area. Gloves Disposable gloves should be worn whenever it is anticipated that an individual will have hand contact with blood or OPIM, and when handling and touching contaminated surfaces. All gloves should be removed prior to leaving the work area, or if they are torn or punctured. Hands should be washed after removing gloves. Gloves should be made of nitrile, rubber, or other water impervious materials. Gloves should always be inspected before each use. Double gloving can provide an additional layer of protection. If you have cuts or sores on your hands, you should cover these with a bandage or similar protection as an additional precaution before donning gloves. Don   t touch the outside of used gloves. Goggles, Face Shields, and Aprons  Goggles should be in use if there is a risk of splashing or vaporization of contaminated fluids. Face shields provide additional protection for the nose and mouth. Aprons and lab coats protect against splash hazards. PPE should be removed before leaving the work area, or when the PPE becomes contaminated. If a garment becomes penetrated, workers must remove the garment as soon as possible, and it should be disposed on a designated biohazardous container. Engineering Controls  Engineering Controls include equipment such as hand washing facilities, eye wash stations, sharps disposal containers, biological safety cabinets, autoclaves, and sharps safety devices are to be used when appropriate. Examples of sharps safety devices include needleless systems and sharps with engineered sharps injury protection (e.g. self-sheathing needle or syringes). Engineering controls must be examined and maintained or replaced on a regular schedule to ensure their effectiveness. Decontamination  All surfaces, tools, equipment and other objects that come in contact with blood or OPIM must be decontaminated and sterilized as soon as possible. Equipment and tools must be cleaned and decontaminated before servicing or being put back to use. Types of disinfecting solutions include a solution of 5.25% sodium hypochlorite (household bleach) diluted between 1 10 and 1 100 with water. The standard recommendation is to use at least a quarter cup of bleach per one gallon of water. In addition, Lysol or some other EPA-registered disinfectant certified to be effective against HIV-1 and hepatitis B virus may be used. Check the label of all disinfectants to make sure they meet this requirement. When cleaning up a contaminated area carefully cover the area with paper towels or rags  gently pour a 10% solution of bleach over the towels or rags  let the disinfectant sit for 10 minutes, then wear gloves to collect & dispose of waste. When cleaning up a blood spill, carefully cover the spill with paper towels or rags, then gently pour your 10% solution of bleach over the towels or rags, and leave it for at least 10 minutes. This will help ensure that the BBP are killed before the actual cleaning begins or wiping the material up. By covering the spill with paper towels or rags, the chances of causing a splash when pouring the bleach are decreased. When decontaminating equipment or other objects (e.g. scalpels, microscope slides, broken glass, saw blades, tweezers, mechanical equipment upon which someone has been cut, first aid boxes) leave the disinfectant in place for at least 10 minutes before continuing the cleaning process. Any materials used to clean up a spill of blood or OPIM must be decontaminated or managed as a biohazard immediately, as well. This would include mops, sponges, re-usable gloves, buckets, pails, etc. Signs and Labeling  In order to comply with OSHA regulations and University requirements, the following information must appear on any items containing biohazard material or waste  Warning labels must be placed on containers of regulated waste, refrigerators and freezers containing blood or OPIM  and other containers used to store, transport, or ship blood or other potentially infectious materials. Employees should be observant of these signs and ensure they are using proper precautions when working, cleaning, etc. in areas posted with these signs. Disposal of Biohazardous Waste  When disposing of contaminated biological waste  Discard in a biohazard bag placed inside a secondary biohazard waste container. Locate containers for regulated waste so they are readily accessible to individuals and as close as possible to the source of the waste. Maintain waste containers in an upright position and do not overfill. Close containers when not actively in use and at the end of the day. Ensure the outside of the biohazard container is not contaminated. Disinfect the outside of the storage container as a secondary precaution. Contain and store waste in accordance with procedures outlined by the medical waste contractor when applicable. Sharps should be disposed of in red labeled containers. The picture below illustrates an example of a sharps container. Emergency Situations In emergency situations where an individual might be exposed to BBP, always use universal precautions to minimize exposure, which may include gloves, splash goggles, pocket mouth-to-mouth resuscitation masks, and other barrier devices. If an individual is exposed, the affected person should take the following steps  Wash the exposed area thoroughly with non-abrasive antibacterial soap and running water. Flush mouth, nose, and eyes for 15 minutes if blood splashed in these areas. Remove clothes that are contaminated with blood as soon as possible and use universal precautions when handling contaminated clothing. Place contaminated items in approved and labeled bags and containers, then dispose of as biohazardous waste. Report the exposure to your supervisor, and complete an exposure report form. It is very important to report exposure incidents as soon as possible to give the best chance to forestall bloodborne pathogen infections, and to prevent the spread of the bloodborne infection to others. Furthermore, it enables the exposed employee to evaluate the circumstances surrounding the exposure and find ways to prevent the situation from occurring again. This form will be kept in the person   s file for 40 years to document workplace exposures to hazardous substances. This report is available from the supervisor or from EHS. The exposed employee may go to the Occupational Health Department at UT Medical Center (or the UT Emergency Room after normal business hours) to request blood testing or the HBV vaccination if not already immunized. Exposed students may go to the Student Health Center on campus for treatment and testing. If one or more individuals must treat an injured employee, here are some guidelines that can be taken to minimize their exposure to BBP  Have disposable gloves (in appropriate size) readily available at all times. Wear two pair of gloves for all spill response activities. If a spill occurs, isolate the contaminated area immediately. Either post someone at the site to keep others out of the area, or close off the area. Other than very minor spills involving a few drops of blood, all spill response procedures should be carried out with two trained persons present if at all possible. If the spill is too large for a single person to manage with the supplies available or if the individual is not confident that he she can manage the spill on their own, the supervisor must be notified and request additional assistance. If the spill includes contaminated broken glass, use mechanical tools to pick up the broken glass. Contaminated broken glass should be placed in a sharps container for disposal if feasible. If this is not feasible, place broken glass in a puncture-resistant bucket. Permanently close the bucket with a lid and place the bucket into a biohazardous waste bag. Blood spill response waste must be disposed of as medical waste. While awaiting disposal, bags of spill waste must be stored in a secure area in a leak-proof container with a lid that is labeled as a biohazard. If clothes become contaminated with blood or OPIM, remove the contaminated clothing items as soon as possible. If the contamination soaked through to the skin, thoroughly flush the exposed skin. (See exposure incident response procedure at the end of this guidance document.) Moderately or heavily contaminated clothing should be laundered on-site separate from other clothing using hot water and a bleach-based detergent. Alternatively, this clothing may be sent to a commercial laundry service that is equipped to process clothing contaminated with blood or OPIM. Contaminated clothing awaiting treatment must be stored in a closed leak-resistant plastic bag tagged with a biohazard symbol. The clothing may also be disposed of as bio-hazardous waste. Always wash your hands after glove removal or anytime they may have come into contact with body fluid contamination. Post Exposure Follow-up An individual who is involved in an exposure incident will be provided a post exposure follow up, which includes laboratory tests  providing confidential medical evaluation, identifying, and testing the source individual, if feasible  testing the exposed employee   s blood, and, with consent of the employee, performing post-exposure prophylaxis  offering counseling  and evaluating reported illnesses. All diagnoses will remain confidential. Exposure Control Plan  OSHA requires that each work place develop and maintain an Exposure Control Plan that is specific to a department. Copies of the exposure plan should be kept in a place readily accessible by all employees. The exposure control plan lists and defines training of affected employees, documentation of exposure, PPE, and other pertinent information specific to that department. Recordkeeping Records shall be maintained as follows Training OSHA BBP - initial and annual refresher training. Communiqu  s from and to  Regulatory agencies Biological disposal vendors Generators of biohazard waste (non-research setting) University administration These records will be kept by EHS. Sharps Injury Log Employee Medical Records Employers must maintain employee medical records. These will be kept by Occupational Health and by the department to an extent. Most of these records must be maintained for three years to meet regulatory requirements.   However, to be prudent these records will be kept indefinitely. Training records and medical records shall be maintained by the individual department to whom the employee or student reports. Training records for employees may also be kept in IRIS. Medical records must be maintained for the duration of the employment plus 30 years in accordance with OSHA   s standard on medical records. Training and Information Supervisors and department heads must ensure that their workers, who have the potential for BBP exposure in their daily duties, receive regular training that covers the dangers of bloodborne pathogens, preventive practices and post-exposure procedures. Departments must offer this training on initial assignment, then at least annually. Initial training should cover the following topics  OSHA   s Bloodborne Pathogens Standard and UTK   s Exposure Control Plan Epidemiology, symptoms and modes of transmission of bloodborne diseases including HIV, HBV and HCV  existence of other blood borne diseases  Methods for recognizing tasks and other activities that may involve exposure to blood and OPIM  Review of use and limitations of methods that will prevent or reduce exposure, including  Engineering controls Work practice controls Personal protective equipment (PPE)  Proper selection, use and disposal of PPE  Visual warning of biohazards including labels, signs and color-coded containers  Information on the HBV vaccine, including its availability, efficacy, safety, benefits, administration, and HBV Vaccination Program  Emergency actions for incidents involving blood or OPIM  Incident reporting and post-exposure follow-up procedures  Post-exposure evaluation and follow-up including medical consultation. EHS offers general training. The departments are required to offer site-specific training.

Effective Date  01 01 2009 Revision Date  10 01 2015 jump to appendices and forms   highlight  Purpose This guideline adheres to the Occupational Safety and Health Administrations (OSHA) compressed gas standards as found in 29 CFR 1910.101. Scope and Applicability This document serves all University department members working within University owned, leased or subsidiary facilities. This guideline is applicable to daily users and those who only occasionally have cause to use the equipment. Abbreviations and Definitions Definitions According to OSHA Hazard Communication Standard a compressed gas is defined as the following  A gas or mixture of gases having, in a container, an absolute pressure exceeding 40 pounds per square inch (psi) at 70   F (21.1   C)  or A gas or mixture of gases having, in a container, an absolute pressure exceeding 104 psi at 130   F (54.4   C) regardless of the pressure at 70   F (21.1    C)  or A liquid having a vapor pressure exceeding 40 psi at 100   F (37.8   C) as determined by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) 323-72. Compressed gases can be toxic, flammable, oxidizing, corrosive or inert. In the event of a leak, inert gases can quickly displace air in a large area creating an oxygen-deficient atmosphere, toxic gases can create poison atmospheres and flammable or reactive gases can result in fire and exploding cylinders. Roles and Responsibilities Managers and Supervisors shall  Assure that equipment associated with the movement, storage and use of compressed gas cylinders is available and properly inspected before being used. Ensure department members conducting work associated with compressed gas and or compressed air equipment have the appropriate training and understand all aspects of safety associated with this equipment. Employees and Students shall  Complete the University   s compressed gas training prior to working with compressed gases in their respective departments. Wear the appropriate personal protective equipment for the task being performed. Inspect hazard control measures and personal protective equipment prior to each use. Maintain awareness of hazards associated with the handling and use of compressed gas. EHS Shall  Perform annual safety inspections in areas where compressed gas cylinders are used on campus. Review and revise the Compressed Gas Guideline on a routine basis. Provide training for people who will use compressed gas cylinders in their jobs. Procedures Recommended Safe Practices for Handling Storage General Safety Requirements All containers shall have their contents identified on the label. Color shall not be used to identify container content. Containers not bearing a legibly written, stamped, or stenciled identification shall not be used and shall be returned to the supplier. The fittings on vessels should not be modified under any circumstances. All compressed gas cylinders, either in use or in storage (empty or full), shall be secured in an upright position by means of a strap, chain or rack. NOTE  Chains and straps secured to the wall should be attached to studs rather than sheet rock to ensure secure points of attachment and shall be around the upper third of the cylinder. Suitable hand trucks, equipped with safety chains, shall be utilized when transporting gas cylinders. Cylinders shall not be rolled in the horizontal position or dragged. Never use the cylinder valve as a handle to move a cylinder. Ropes, chains or slings shall not be used to suspend containers unless equipped with appropriate lifting attachments such as lugs. Where attachments have not been provided, suitable cradles or platforms to hold the containers shall be used for lifting. Protective valve caps must be in place when cylinders are not in use. Do not switch caps, since not all suppliers use the same cap threads. Container valves shall be closed at all times (full or empty) except when the container is in use. Valve outlets shall be pointed away from all personnel when the valve is being opened. All cylinders, lines, and equipment used with flammable compressed gases shall be grounded. Cylinders used in conjunction with electric welding shall not be grounded or used for grounding. When in use, all cylinders must be equipped with an appropriate regulating device. All regulators must be marked to identify the gas (or group of compatible gases) with which the regulator is to be used. Regulator threads must match cylinder valve outlet threads. Adapters shall never be used to attach a regulator to a cylinder that it is not designed. When a cylinder is in use, a hand wheel, valve handle, spindle key or special tool to open the cylinder valve shall be attached to the cylinder so that it will be available immediately in the event of an emergency. Cylinders containing compressed gases shall be used only in well-ventilated areas. Cylinders containing toxic or flammable gases must be stored in an approved storage area. Storage areas shall be prominently posted with the hazard class or the name of the gases stored. Containers shall not be stored near elevators, walkway, unprotected platform edges, or in locations where heavy moving objects may strike or fall on them. Stored containers (inside or outside) shall not obstruct exit routes or other areas normally used or intended for the safe exit of personnel. Cylinders containing oxidizing gases, such as oxygen and nitrous oxide, shall be stored separately from flammable gases or liquids. Separation will be 25 feet or by a fire-rated wall. Flammable gases shall be stored in well-ventilated areas away from oxidizers, open flames, sparks, and other sources of heat or ignition. Empty cylinders shall be so identified and stored separately from full or partially full cylinders. Compressed gas cylinders shall be used only for their intended purposes. Compressed gases should be handled only by experienced and properly instructed personnel. Cryogenic Liquids Cryogenic liquids are gases handled in liquid form at relatively low pressures and extremely low temperatures (usually below -130   F (-90   C)). Because of their low temperatures, cryogenic liquids are handled in double-wall, vacuum-insulated containers to lessen evaporation and venting of gas. Some cryogenic liquids in small quantities are also handled in open, low pressure, thermos-type containers (dewars) in laboratory work. When handling cryogenic liquids, wear suitable eye protection, such as a face shield and safety glasses or safety goggles. Wear hand protection, such as insulated gloves, to prevent contact with cold liquid, cold gas, and cold equipment or piping. Gloves should be loose fitting so that they can be readily removed in the event liquid is splashed into them. Wear cuff-less trousers over (outside) high-topped shoes to prevent spills from being trapped in shoes or allowed to contact the feet. Handle and store containers in an upright position. The containers shall not be dropped, tipped over, or rolled on their sides. Use a four- wheel hand truck designed to move such containers to move cryogenic liquefied gas containers with a capacity greater than 20 gal (76 L). Store and handle cryogenic liquefied gas containers in well-ventilated areas to prevent hazardous concentration of the gas. Containers and equipment assigned for a specific cryogenic liquefied gas service shall not be used for the storage or use of another cryogenic liquefied gas. Provide gas containers with pressure relief devices adequate to relieve excessive pressures within the containers. Where cryogenic liquefied gas or cold gas may be trapped in piping between valves, equip the piping with a pressure relief device. Only transfer lines designed for cryogenic liquefied gases shall be used. It is recommended that all vents be piped to the exterior of the building. Store and transfer cryogenic liquids under positive pressure to prevent the infiltration and solidification of moisture, air, or other gases. Personal Protective Equipment The hazards associated with the compressed gases and equipment at the University of New Haven has been assessed and the University has taken measures to eliminate or reduce their presence with engineering and administrative controls. Where these controls were not enough for employee protection, all necessary personal protective equipment has been supplied according to the University   s Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Guideline and Procedure. General requirements for the use of personal protective equipment include wearing protective gloves when using gases that are harmful to the skin. Aprons or other protective clothing may be needed depending on the risk of skin contact. University department members are instructed to consult the material safety data sheet before handling a compressed gas for appropriate manufacturer personal protective equipment recommendations. Eye protection must always be worn when handling and working with compressed gases. In some cases additional protection may be needed in the form of a face shield when working with compressed gases. Inspection Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) shall conduct hazard surveillance of all laboratories, and other areas on campus that use compressed gas cylinders (i.e. shop areas) annually.   During the annual site visit the storage and use of compressed gas cylinders shall be evaluated. Deficiencies shall be noted on the standard inspection form and communicated to the responsible individual.   The person responsible for the area that contains cylinder deficiencies shall make corrections and respond to the EHS. Chemical Inventory Compressed gas cylinders shall be included on the chemical inventory for each department that contains these vessels.   For additional information consult EHS or safety guideline number EC 5 regarding compressed gas cylinders and chemical inventory. Training and Information All personnel working with compressed gas cylinders shall be trained in safety and proper procedures. Training should include the following as a minimum, as applicable  General safety procedures for use with compressed gas cylinders or medical gases including  safety hazards associated with the gases hazards associated with high-pressure cylinders hazards associated with the specific equipment hazards associated with contaminated tools, parts, etc. Procedures to prevent cross connections of medical gas pipelines. NOTE  Many older outlets are not inherently safe from cross connection due to common threads or fittings used for different gases. Mechanical skills required for work on equipment. Procedures to follow prior to any shutdown of a service or during an emergency. Location, operation, and areas controlled for all valves. Training should be conducted and documented annually. Training records shall be kept for at least three years.

Notify EHS of changes in work areas or work processes and practices to evaluate the need for new installations, or for the removal of existing emergency eyewashes or showers. Test all emergency equipment after installation to ensure that it meets the manufacturer   s installation requirements. Units that fail testing must be repaired immediately. If deficiencies cannot be immediately corrected, the lab supervisor or principal investigator (PI) must be notified and the unit must be tagged    DO NOT USE   . The lab supervisor or PI must notify all affected employees when emergency equipment is out of service. A portable unit may be temporarily required to meet the need for an emergency eyewash and shower. Test eyewashes located in hallways weekly and perform annual tests on safety showers. Procedures Emergency eyewashes, showers, drench hoses and combination units are not substitutes for proper primary protective devices. As a defense against flying solid particles and splashing injurious liquids, workers must wear personal protective equipment as needed, including eye protection, face protection and protective clothing. The first seconds following an incident involving the eyes are often most critical to keeping injury to a minimum. A personal eyewash may be kept in the immediate vicinity of employees working in a potentially hazardous area. The main purpose of these units is to supply immediate flushing. Note that a personal eyewash is not a substitute for a code compliant eyewash. With this accomplished, the injured individual should then proceed to a plumbed or self-contained eyewash and flush the eyes for the required minimum 15-minute period. General Installation Safety showers and eyewashes shall be installed and maintained in compliance with applicable engineering standards and shall be supplied from potable water. Pipelines and other parts of safety showers and eyewash stations shall not be used as supports for other types of equipment or fixtures. The access routes to safety showers and eyewash stations shall not be blocked. The location of safety showers and eyewash stations may need to be identified with signs that are prominently displayed for immediate recognition if the location is not evident. Safety showers and eyewash stations shall be in accessible locations that require no more than 10 seconds for the exposed person to reach along an unobstructed pathway (i.e., no doors which don   t swing open when pushed. No obstructions, protrusions, or sharp objects shall be located within 16 inches from the center of the spray pattern of the emergency shower facility. Electrical apparatus, telephones, thermostats, or power outlets should not be located within 18 inches of either side of the emergency shower or emergency eyewash facility (i.e., a 36-inch clearance zone). Provisions should be made for wastewater disposal for new installations. Maintenance Fixed eyewash stations shall be activated weekly to flush the line for a minimum of three minutes and verify proper operation. ANSI standard Z358.1 requires that emergency showers and eyewashes be tested weekly. This involves opening flow through the nozzles to verify that sufficient fluid is available to neutralize and wash away any corrosive material from a user. In addition, the eyewash fluid should be checked for debris and foreign objects that might cause injury to the eyes. This weekly testing must be documented and should be performed by the department that controls the eyewash. An eyewash test log shall be kept near the eyewash. Appendix A is a test log that can be used to document the weekly test. For portable units the duration of flushing will be dependent upon the specified maintenance criteria.   Eyewashes will be flushed by Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) during the annual safety inspection if this activity can be performed safely or without damaging equipment. Personal eyewash units shall be replaced upon expiration of the container. Safety showers shall be activated annually by Facilities Services to flush the line and verify proper operation. Documentation of this activity shall be documented on a tag attached to the shower. It is the department   s responsibility to ensure that emergency eyewash and safety shower equipment that does not pass inspection is repaired immediately by contacting Facilities or EHS. Whenever an emergency eyewash or safety shower is non-functional, immediately contact Facilities Services to make repairs. Do not handle hazardous materials in that work-area until the unit is returned to proper service. Any party removing emergency eyewash or safety shower equipment from service, must notify the affected department beforehand. Individuals who may be exposed to hazardous materials shall be instructed in the location and proper use of emergency eyewash and safety shower equipment. Portable Eyewash Stations Self-contained (portable) eyewash stations are used only as a temporary measure or in areas where it is not feasible to install a fixed eyewash station. The water in these units shall be changed as recommended by the manufacturer. Specifications Listed below are recommended standards for installation of safety showers, eye face and drench hoses. Note that the water temperature should not exceed 100 degrees F and should not be lower than 60 degrees F. Plumbed Safety Showers Heads shall be positioned no less than 82    from floor and have a spray pattern with a minimum diameter of 20    at 60    above the floor. The flow rate shall be at least 20 gallons per minute (GPM) at a velocity low enough to be non-injurious to the user. The center of spray pattern shall be located at least 16    from any obstruction. The valve shall activate in one second or less, have a stay-on feature and stay on until manual reset. The handle should be placed a maximum of 69    from the standing surface. The valve should be simple to operate and shall go from    off    to    on    in one second or less. Eyewash Stations  An eye wash unit permanently connected to a source of potable water. Heads must be protected from airborne contaminants and positioned six inches from the wall or nearest obstruction. The flow rate shall be at least 0.4 gpm for 15 minutes for plumbed units with the valve activating in one second or less. The unit shall have a stay-open valve (leaving hands free) feature. Eye Face Wash    A device used to irrigate and flush both the face and eyes. Heads shall be positioned 33    to 45    from the floor and no closer than six inches from the wall or nearest obstruction. Large heads to cover both eyes and face or regular size eyewash heads plus a face spray ring. Flow rate should not be less than 0.4 GPM for 15 minutes. The valve shall activate in one second or less and shall have a stay-open valve (leaving hands free) feature. Drench Hoses  A flexible hose connected to a water supply and used to irrigate and flush eyes, face and body areas. Hand-held drench hoses support shower and eyewash units but shall not replace them. Heads shall have a flow rate of at least 0.4 gpm for 15 minutes. The valve shall activate in one second or less Training and Information All employees working with hazardous chemicals materials who may have to use an eyewash or a safety shower shall be trained in the use of the equipment before use. Employees should also be made aware of the location of eyewash stations and safety showers before working with hazardous chemicals in their work areas. This information may be included in the department-specific Hazard Communication training or in the department   s chemical hygiene plan.

Staff and students who use Local Exhaust Ventilation Systems shall  Attend training as needed Use the LEVs in accordance with their design and limitations Report any problems associated with the LEVs. Procedures Local exhaust system is used to control air contaminants by trapping them at or near the source, in contrast to dilution ventilation which lets the contaminant spread throughout the workplace. Local exhaust is generally a far more effective way of controlling highly toxic contaminants before they reach the workers  breathing zones. This type of system is usually the preferred control method if  Air contaminants pose serious health risk. Large amounts of dusts or fumes are generated. Increased heating costs from ventilation in cold weather are a concern. Emission sources are few in number. Emission sources are near the workers  breathing zones. Before installing any type of exhaust system, even effort needs to be made to 1. Isolate the contaminant as much as possible, 2. Change processes so that the contaminant exposure is minimized or eliminated, 3. Substitute a less harmful substance to be used in the process. There are advantages and disadvantages to the use of either dilution ventilation or local exhaust ventilation in terms of costs and effectiveness. Below is a table which lists all of the types of ventilation and examples of their uses  Type of Ventilation Examples of Use General laboratory ventilation Nonvolatile chemicals Nonhazardous materials Environmental rooms Materials that require special environmental controls Nonhazardous amounts of flammable, toxic, or reactive chemicals. Laboratory chemical hoods Flammable, toxic, or reactive materials Products or mixtures with uncharacterized hazards Unventilated storage cabinets Flammable liquids Corrosives Moderately toxic chemicals Ventilated storage cabinets Highly toxic, hazardous, or odiferous chemicals (if equipped with flame arrestors) Recirculating biosafety cabinets Biological materials Nanoparticles, as of the date of publication Biological materials Nanoparticles, as of the date of publication Minute amounts of volatile chemicals Total exhaust biosafety cabinet Biological materials Nanoparticles, as of the date of publication Minute amounts of volatile chemicals Glove box Positive pressure for specialty environments Negative pressure for highly toxic materials Downdraft table Perfusions with paraformaldehyde, work with volatile, low to moderately hazardous materials with higher vapor density where access from more than one side is necessary Elephant trunk Local ventilation of a tabletop Discharge from equipment such as a gas chromatograph Canopy Ventilation of heat, steam, low or nontoxic materials with low vapor density Ductless laboratory chemical hood Materials that are compatible with the filtration system, in controlled quantities and under controlled conditions Not suitable for particularly hazardous substances Slot hood Local ventilation of higher density materials at the source, such as an acid bath Ventilated balance enclosure Weighing and initial dissolution of highly toxic or potent materials Bench top ventilated enclosures Bench top equipment, such as rotary evaporators Testing  Local Exhaust Systems should be tested a minimum of once year and also at the following times  Manufacturer performs containment tests. Containment test after installation and prior to initial use Annual (at the minimum) face velocity and airflow visualization Performance test any time a potential problem is reported Containment test after significant changes to the ventilation system (i.e. rebalancing, decommissioning). When an employee requests an inspection When a procedural change requires a hood classification upgrade After major repair work After a fume hood is moved LEVs will be tested annually by EHS, or an authorized company, and will be tested after repairs are made by Facilities Services. Roof Work LEV exhaust ducts terminate just above the roofline in many cases. Working near these outlets could potentially expose workers to hazardous chemicals, albeit in extremely dilute concentrations. If maintenance repair work must be done on the roof of any building containing hood exhaust(s), Facilities must first notify the appropriate supervisor of the work to be performed. If needed, the laboratory manager shall provide to facility and or contractor staff information regarding chemicals used in their fume hoods. It may be necessary to cease work in fume hoods until roof work is complete. Personal Monitoring  If there is concern that an LEV is not providing enough worker protection, personal sampling may be necessary to ensure there is no overexposure.   EHS can provide assistance in these cases upon request. Using Local Exhaust Devices Exhaust devices should not be used for purposes for which their design is not intended, for instance, using perchloric acid in a general purpose lab hood or using hazardous chemicals in a recirculating hood. (Perchloric acid should only be used in a dedicated and approved hood.) Also, laminar flow clean benches which blow HEPA filtered air toward an operator and contain no means for contaminant capture and exhaust, are not to be used with hazardous materials. Contact EHS for the guidelines and for training on the use, function, and limitations of ventilation devices. Assure that high hazard processes have automatic shutdown controls should exhaust fail. Normally closed pneumatic valves, flow limiting orifices, over pressure or over temperature controls, and other appropriate safety devices may be needed for high hazard experiments and processes. Assure that exhaust devices used for chemical handling (fume hoods, laminar flow chemical hoods, biological safety cabinets) are checked on an annual basis for proper flow. Contact EHS if certification sticker indicates date of inspection greater than one year old. Assure exhaust monitors and alarms, where present, are always functional. Do not alter or tap into exhaust ducts or exhaust devices. Modifications to the exhaust system, including adjusting dampers, penetrating walls or work surfaces, or adding or removing services may only be performed through Facilities Services. Understand any ventilation alarms that are in place in your work area. Train all new employees on proper work practices, meaning of exhaust alarms, and actions to take in the event of an emergency. Contact EHS or Facilities Services if there are changes observed in the exhaust device s performance, including a change in face velocity or inadequate capture of contaminants. Notify your building preventative maintenance contact if you notice excessive noise or vibration. Contact Facilities Services for information on clean air hoods  maintenance, including HEPA filter changing, decontamination and annual certification of biological safety cabinets. Training and Information All laboratory personnel should receive training that includes How to use the ventilation equipment, Familiarity with OSHA regulations concerning ventilation systems Role of ventilation in contaminant control Consequences of improper use, What to do in the event of system failure, What to do in the event of a power outage, Special considerations or rules for the equipment, Significance of signage and postings. Position required to be in which working near exhaust hood Knowledge of tests and inspection procedures How to handle fire in ducts How to handle breakdowns which cause hazardous or nuisance conditions Recordkeeping All records concerning installation and maintenance of various LEVs on campus will be maintained by Facilities Services and EHS will maintain all annual face velocity testing records for chemical fume hoods, and other LEVs not checked by authorized company.

Maintain selected records UT employees and students who use respirators shall  Use provided respiratory protection in accordance with the instructions, Attend required training and fit testing, Immediately report any malfunction of the respirator to their supervisor or instructor, Notify their supervisor or instructor when a change in their health status occurs that could affect their ability to use a respirator. Comply with all required components of the UT Respiratory Protection Program (medical surveillance, training and fit-testing) before using any respirator. Use respiratory protection equipment as instructed and in accordance with all provisions of the UT Respiratory Protection Program and OSHA requirements, Properly store, clean, inspect and maintain all assigned respirator equipment, Inform supervisors or instructors of new situations that may require a change in the use of respiratory protection equipment, or if contaminant levels are suspected to increase, Report any respirator deficiencies or malfunctions to their supervisor or instructor, Use the correct type of respiratory protection for the hazard(s) involved, Immediately follow emergency procedures and leave the respirator use area if a respirator fails to provide proper protection. Procedures Medical Evaluation All employees will complete an OSHA Respirator Medical Evaluation Questionnaire before using a respirator. The questionnaire will be submitted to Student Health by EHS to be evaluated by a qualified person. Pass Fail information will be entered with records kept by EHS. Pre-employment physical examinations will be conducted on all employees required to wear a negative-pressure respirator and who failed the initial medical evaluation questionnaire. Follow-up medical evaluations shall be provided, at no expense to the employee, when a change in the respirator user   s health is noted. The respirator users, his or her supervisor or the respiratory protection program administrator may request the need for a follow-up medical evaluation. Respirator Selection The basic purpose of any respirator is to protect the user from specific inhalation hazards.     Respirators provide protection by removing contaminants from the air before inhalation or by supplying an independent source of respirable air. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) establishes assigned protection factors for different levels of respiratory protection.     The following table indicates the various types of respirators available, and the maximum assigned protection factor assigned to each*  Respirator Type Assigned Protection Factor Filtering Facepiece Respirators 10 Air-Purifying Half-Mask Respirators 10 Loose-Fitting Air-Purifying Respirators 25 Air-Purifying Full-Face Respirators 50 Tight Fitting Powered Air-Purifying Respirators (full-face) 1000 Air Line Respirators 1000 Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) 10,000 * The Assigned Protection Factors (APFs) shall comply with any changes to 29 CFR 1910.134(d)(3)(i)(A). Maximum acceptable airborne levels for respirator users are determined by multiplying the Assigned Protection Factor by OSHA   s Permissible Exposure Level. Only NIOSH approved respirators will be used in this program. The choice of respirators will be dependent upon the following information  The airborne contaminants and concentration present. The physical, chemical, and toxicological properties of the contaminants. Odor threshold data (warning properties). Applicable exposure limits. Eye irritation potential. Service life information available on cartridges or canisters. Fitting of Respirators Requirements for Fit Testing Fit testing shall occur annually. Fit tester training programs will be utilized and the appropriately trained individuals may be used for specific departmental fit testing. Additional fit testing may be required when a respirator user or other individual reports changes in the user   s physical condition that could affect the respirator fit. These changes could include facial scarring, dental changes, cosmetic surgery, a significant change in body weight, etc. Fit testing must be conducted using an OSHA-accepted protocol. Individuals with facial hair that interferes with the seal of the respirator will be requested to remove the interfering facial hair or sign a waiver stating that they declined to be fit tested. Individuals who cannot be fitted with an approved respirator may use a loose-fitting PAPR if available and acceptable for the hazards present.    Single use respirators (example N-95) Single use respirators may be provided within limitations. Only tested and certified respirators shall be used. Single use respirators will be discarded at the end of each shift or more frequently based on a change schedule Visibly soiled or contaminated respirators will be discarded immediately after use. Inspection, Cleaning, Repair and Storage The following are key elements of a good respiratory protection program. Inspection     Respirators shall be inspected for defects (including a leak check) before and after each use. Visual inspection shall include a check of the tightness of connections and the condition of the face piece, headbands, valves, connecting tube, and cartridges or canisters. Rubber or elastomer parts shall be inspected for pliability and signs of deterioration. Cleaning and disinfecting. Respirators shall be cleaned and disinfected as frequently as necessary to ensure that proper protection is provided for the wearer. Repair or replace damaged part. Only factory authorized persons shall make repairs with parts from the manufacturer designed for the respirator Storage - Respirators shall be stored to protect against dust, sunlight, heat, extreme cold, excessive moisture, theft, physical damage, or damaging chemicals. Cleaned respirators will be kept in a clean, plastic bag and in a designated location. When storing a respirator, the face piece and exhalation valve must be in a normal position to prevent the abnormal set of elastomer parts during storage. Evaluation of Program Effectiveness Frequent unscheduled observation of activities throughout the facility will be conducted to confirm proper respirator use. This may be included as part of the periodic EHS building inspection program. Observations and discussion with new respirator users throughout the campus will be conducted to evaluate compliance. The overall effectiveness of the respirator program will be evaluated as necessary by the program administrator with actions taken to correct any defects found in the program. Training and Information Each individual assigned to an area requiring the use of a respirator will be shown and instructed on how to use (including putting on and removing) the respirator properly. Each individual will be trained why the respirator is necessary and on its limitations. Employees required to wear respirators will be instructed to immediately leave a contaminated area upon suspicion of respirator failure. A record shall be maintained of training and fit testing.    Recordkeeping Record Storage location Minimum length of record retention Medical Evaluation EHS 40 years Air Monitoring Results EHS 40 years MSDS SDS EHS 40 years Respirator Fit Testing (Including Brand and Size) EHS 3 years Employee Training Department Responsible Unit 3 years Medical records shall be secured to control access.

Procedures Background Information Air monitoring may be conducted for a number of reasons listed below  Regulatory compliance (e.g. OSHA) Validation of controls (e.g. properly functioning local exhaust ventilation) Employee concern Characterization of potential exposure to an air contaminant Results of air monitoring are log-normally distributed and can vary greatly. Professional judgment must be exercised when developing an air monitoring plan and interpreting results. EHS can conduct live time monitoring or collect samples for laboratory analysis for a myriad of chemicals. These assessments are conducted either qualitatively (to observe for the presence of contaminants) or quantitatively to conduct testing and determine actual concentrations of exposure by an individual. Air Sampling Sampling shall be personal (monitor worn on the employee), in the breathing zone and shall characterize short-duration high-level exposures (ceiling, excursion and short-term exposure limits (STEL)) as well as long duration time-weighted averages where applicable. Some air contaminants list only a short-term or long duration acceptable exposure standard. The monitoring accuracy shall be within 25% of the published standard at the 95% confidence level. In some cases, area monitoring may be conducted to establish background levels, evaluate indoor air quality and validate controls. The sampling shall accurately characterize all activities (work tasks) where exposure is likely to occur. Where repeated sampling has demonstrated the exposure has fallen below the action level or one-half of any recognized standard, the monitoring may be discontinued. Sampling may be necessary when there is a change in the process, work activity, substance or equipment. A representative shall periodically check employees who are being monitored. The monitoring shall be conducted to determine that the sampler is being used correctly, not subject to interference and to characterize work activities and exposures. Employee Concerns  Indoor air quality problems can come from a variety of sources either inside or outside the building. The agent responsible for the complaint may be transient, intermittent or chronic and it may be chemical, biological or physical in nature. Individual response to an airborne substance can vary greatly as can an individual s perception of comfort. Other factors can also influence an individual s perception of comfort and should be considered. Allergies (diagnosed or undiagnosed) can be affected by trace amounts of airborne matter. Airborne particulate and biological organisms can represent a serious hazard for individuals who are immune-compromised. Air monitoring can be expensive, is often inconclusive and must be carefully evaluated when conducted. The person or person who is affected by the indoor air quality or their supervisor should notify EHS or Facilities Services. Notification may be by telephone, e-mail, verbal, written letter or other means. A Request for Service form (Appendix E) can be completed and submitted to EHS. No employee shall be retaliated against for initiating a complaint. However, the person submitting the complaint may remain anonymous if so desired. Individuals wishing to remain anonymous should make this wish known at the initial communiqu  . See safety plan GS 100, Reporting Safety Hazards for additional details. The complaint shall be investigated and a corrective action recommended. The complaint may be investigated and resolved by a single department (e.g. EHS). However, it is generally best to take a team approach and involve other departments. When an indoor air quality complaint is complex or the agent(s) is are unknown, a team approach is certainly warranted. The investigation shall be made in a timely manner based on the perceived degree of hazard. Results of the investigation shall be communicated to the person(s) who initiated the complaint. This shall also apply to cases where the source(s) of the complaint cannot be determined. EHS shall also inform the complainant of the degree of risk (risk communication). Facilities Services shall be responsible for evaluating the building   s mechanical systems relative to the indoor air quality complaint. Tools and Techniques Used to Characterize and Evaluate Indoor Air Quality Problems In some cases the cause(s) of an indoor air quality complaint are obvious and an exhaustive review of the building is unnecessary. However, often the cause is unknown and a more rigorous approach must be taken to identify the agent(s). Appendix B (Indoor Air Quality Checklist) and Appendix C (Occupant Diary) may be used to identify potential problems. Note that other data collection tools may also be used at the discretion of the investigator. Air monitoring for mold may be conducted, however, it is generally the responsibility of the department requesting the sampling to pay for this service.   EHS can obtain mold sampling equipment, collect samples using recognized protocol and interpret the results, upon request of the department. Frequency of Air Monitoring Air monitoring shall be conducted in accordance with regulatory (e.g. OSHA) requirements and periodically based on professional judgment. Repeat air monitoring shall be conducted when results are equal to or greater than the defined action limit (generally considered to be one-half of the permissible exposure level) accounting for sampling and analytical errors. Quality Control Utmost care shall be taken to ensure that air monitoring is conducted in accordance with accepted industrial hygiene practices. For valid results all aspects of sampling and analysis must be controlled. Sampling protocols for the sampling media and method shall be maintained in the EHS office.     Batches of air sampling generally will include a blank. Sample spikes may be used periodically. Equipment Calibration Equipment shall be calibrated as needed. Results of the calibration shall be recorded in the field air monitoring worksheet (Appendix A) and air monitoring database. Calibration standards (e.g. span gas) shall be kept current (e.g. not expired).   Instruments may be periodically sent to the factory for calibration, maintenance and repair. Laboratory Analysis Only American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) accredited laboratories shall be used to analyze samples. The type of analysis shall be dictated by regulatory requirements. Professional judgment may be used when no regulatory guidance is available. Regulatory Standards OSHA is usually the primary source of regulations that address air monitoring and worker protection. It should be noted that a number of substances (e.g. formaldehyde and lead) have specific standards, so the applicable section of OSHA must be consulted regarding sampling methodology, frequency, etc. When OSHA does not address a particular substance, other recognized standards such as ACGIH, AIHA, NIOSH or industry standards will be used. When no recognized standards exist, professional judgment shall be used to evaluate the acceptable exposure level. Factors to weigh include applicable routes of exposure, similarity to other recognized chemical hazards, current research and safety factors. Indoor mold currently has no federal or state regulatory standards. Regulated Area When air monitoring results indicate that an action limit has been routinely exceeded, that area shall be posted. The text of the posting shall be done in accordance with OSHA regulations. Air Monitoring of Spills and Unplanned Releases Chemical spills can result in airborne exposures that substantially exceed published limits. Air monitoring prior to clean up can define the necessary level of personal protective equipment. Monitoring after spill cleanup will provide documentation of safely to re-occupy the space. Employees of EHS may use air monitoring as part of the spill cleanup process to assess the hazard. The preferred method of air monitoring for spills is direct reading equipment. Notification of Employees and Risk Communication All employees shall be notified as soon as possible of the results of their air monitoring, but in no case more than five working days past the date of receipt of the results. The notification shall be done in writing or by posting results. Where the results exceed a regulatory standard, or action level, the notification shall also include the steps to be taken to control the exposure. Included with the results shall be a comparison between the employee s exposure and reference standards such as the OSHA permissible exposure level, ACGIH or the NIOSH. The risk associated with exposure to the contaminants, based on the air monitoring results, shall be explained to the employee. Limitations of IAQ Investigations Sampling methodologies and acceptable exposure limits have been established for many workplace contaminants. However, workers may continue to experience discomfort at contaminant levels below the standards set for occupational exposure. Individual sensitivities vary and the ability to measure possible irritants at low concentrations may be limited by technology.   Thus, irritants may be present at low concentrations that are undetected but which may cause health effects in sensitive individuals. Also, the sampling and measuring of indoor mold contamination in the air and on surfaces is of limited value as mold is found in virtually all environments and because no consensus standards or regulatory standards have been established. Indoor Environmental Quality Checklist Building Occupants The following list notes items or procedures that should be followed in order to minimize the risk of creating a potential IAQ problem. This list should also be used as a guideline for an initial site- based investigation if an IAQ complaint is reported. Clean-up any spills or leaks immediately. Eating should be limited to designated areas due to the potential for the development of vermin and cleaning problems. Limit the amount of clutter. Excess supplies and personal items stored on the floor or on open shelves make it difficult to adequately clean a room. Closed cabinets are preferable for storage rather than open shelving. The use of chemical air fresheners (i.e.    Plug-ins   , sprays) should be limited in use, due to their tendency to emit volatile organic compounds (VOC) that may trigger a sensitive individual   s asthma or other respiratory condition. Do not alter or block air flows to and from air conditioning diffusers without first contacting Facilities Services. Realize that, depending on the type of air conditioning system, it may not be possible to open windows and doors without affecting air flows and temperatures throughout the whole system. Do not bring in insecticides from home. Pest control concerns need to be brought to the attention of Pest Management. Do not over water potted plants. Eliminate standing water in the bottoms of plant pots. Note that potted plants can be a significant source of mold in an indoor environment. Sewer gas odor issues are often due to dried out sink or floor drain traps. Pouring a bucket of water into a floor drain or running the water in a sink for a minute or two will often eliminate the odor. Wash hands frequently to help prevent the spread of infectious illnesses such as the flu and colds. If an IAQ concern involves some foul odor in a particular room, an inspection should be made for a dead animal, a forgotten lunch or some other possible cause within that room prior to contacting EHS. IAQ Concern Resolution Overview The greatest challenge posed by IAQ concerns is that the reported symptoms and health complaints   are generally diverse and usually not suggestive of any particular medical diagnosis or readily associated with a causative agent. Typically, physical symptoms includes headaches, unusual fatigue, itching or burning eyes, skin irritation, nasal congestion, dry or irritated throats, and other respiratory irritations. The workplace environment is frequently implicated because workers report that their symptoms diminish or cease once they leave the workplace. In such cases, however, it is often difficult to ascertain causation and or substantiate a violation. Strategies for investigating indoor air quality problems can be very straightforward in that relevant information is gathered and conclusions are drawn based on findings.   In the absence of specific contaminant sources or obvious ventilation problems, EHS will try to analyze the scope of the problem and systematically identify or eliminate elements which are specifically associated with IAQ episodes. It should be noted that an overwhelming majority of investigations of campus ventilation systems reveal that they are well maintained and operating properly. When the occupant believes the cause of physical symptoms is the quality of the indoor air, the following typical procedure will be followed by EHS (the scope may vary depending on findings). EHS Response Meeting  an EHS staff person will meet with someone familiar with the problem, usually the affected person(s) or a supervisor, to identify the specific concern. Walk-through  an initial walk-through will be conducted by EHS to possibly identify immediately correctable causes or to develop a plan for conducting a more thorough investigation. Scope  strategies hypotheses are developed to evaluate suspected problems Initial Sampling  a preliminary IAQ sample may be conducted. An instrument will be used that measures temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. Temperature  ASHRAE recommended ranges of 73   F to 79   F during the winter months and 69 to 75 during summer months will be evaluated. During normal occupied hours, the target indoor air temperature at UTK shall be 68 degrees Fahrenheit for heating and 76 degrees Fahrenheit for cooling. Facilities Services shall ensure that building spaces areas close to these set points as possible. Exceptions to these temperatures must be approved.   Please see UTK   s Energy Conservation Policy for more information. Relative Humidity  levels can affect the release rate of many indoor contaminants, their concentrations in the air, and the potential growth of microbial organisms. In ASHRAE 55-1981, an acceptable range of humidity is 20 to 60%. Carbon Dioxide  is used as an indicator to evaluate the performance of ventilation systems. Ordinary outside air in urban areas normally contain about 300 to 500 parts per million (ppm). ASHRAE standard 62-2001 (Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor Air Quality) recommends that CO2 levels not exceed 700 ppm above outdoor ambient levels. OSHA limits carbon dioxide concentration in the workplace to 5,000 ppm for prolonged periods, and 35,000 ppm for 15 minutes. Carbon Monoxide  indoor levels of CO are generally similar to levels found in the air outside of the occupied building. The current regulatory permissible exposure limit (PEL) as set by TOSHA is 35 ppm. Involve Other Department  EHS will call upon Facilities Services for their expertise. Evaluate Findings  conditions and measured monitoring results are compared to criteria established through standards, codes, guidelines and good practice. Identify Solutions  the need for corrective actions and controls is identified, and solutions are recommended. Correction  controls and recommendations are implemented as necessary. Follow-Up  findings and results are communicated to concerned parties. Investigations will not be initiated over issues of comfort, and such issues normally will not result in a walk-through or follow-up. Training and Information EHS and Facilities Services staff shall be adequately trained to recognize, evaluate and suggest controls for indoor air quality problems. Recordkeeping Records, including the air monitoring field worksheets, and laboratory analytical results shall be permanently maintained in an electronic format or paper copy in the EHS office. EHS shall document all indoor air quality complaints that they investigate, as well as laboratory testing results (i.e. mold). Records shall be maintained for at least three years.

Effective Date  01 01 2009 Revision Date  04 02 2015 jump to appendices and forms   highlight  Purpose This program is designed to prevent hearing loss for students, staff and employees while engaged in university-sponsored activities. Scope and Applicability This program shall apply to all employees, students and visitors to the University who are expected to be exposed to noise great enough to cause hearing damage.   As a reference, 85 decibels, A-scale, (dBA) for an average of 8-hours per day shall be used.   If octave band analysis is used to determine noise exposure, table G-9 in 29 CFR 1910.95 can be used. The provisions for audiometric testing and associated record keeping and training shall not apply to students or visitors.   This program shall not apply to individuals attending events on campus for entertainment purposes. Abbreviations and Definitions Abbreviations ANSI     American National Standards Institute dBA     decibels (A-scale) EHS     Environmental Health and Safety NRR     Noise reduction rating OSHA     Occupational Safety and Health Administration Definitions Action Level  An 8-hour time weighted average (TWA) of 85 decibels measured on the A-weighted scale, slow response, or equivalently a dose of 50%. Weighted Sound Level (dBA)  The weighting of sound levels that represents the function of the human ear. Audiometric Testing Program  The portion of the Hearing Conservation Program that consists of measuring an employee s hearing threshold to establish a baseline and for subsequent comparisons. Decibel (dB)  Unit of measurement of sound level. Dose  A ratio of noise exposure relative to the noise criterion level of 90 decibels, expressed as a percentage. Ninety decibels represents a dose of 100% over an 8-hour work shift. Eighty-five decibels represents a dose of 50% over an 8-hour work shift. Hearing Protection Attenuation  The estimated reduction in the noise level at the eardrum as a result of the use of hearing protection. Noise Induced Hearing Loss, NIHL  The OSHA recordable occupationally related hearing loss, as defined by 29 CFR 1904.10 and 29 CFR 1904.5, and includes a Standard Threshold Shift (STS) of 10 db, with age correction, averaged over the 2K, 3K, and 4K frequencies from baseline in either ear and a 25 db shift from audiometric zero, in the same ear as the 10 dB STS at the same frequencies. Noise Reduction Rating (NRR)  The theoretical maximum amount of noise reduction that can be achieved using a hearing protection device. This is a manufacturers    calculated value and must be displayed with the hearing protection device. Monitoring    The sampling of noise levels using a sound level meter, octave band analyzer, or personal noise dosimeter. Permissible Noise Exposure  The maximum daily noise exposure which may be experienced by employees not using hearing protectors from a continuous 8-hour exposure to a sound level of 90 dBA or equivalent dose of 100%. Standard Threshold Shift (STS)  A change in hearing threshold, relative to the most recent audiogram for that employee, of an average of 10 decibels (dB) or more at 2000, 3000, and 4000 hertz in one or both ears and substantiated within 30 days with a follow-up audiogram. Time Weighted Average (TWA)  The  equivalent  noise level, in dB, based on an 8-hour exposure time frame. If the noise is not constant over an 8-hour exposure, then a calculated 8-hour TWA must be made using the equation in Table 1. The TWA may also be estimated from the dose or percent noise exposure, based on noise exposure continuous over 8-hours, as given in Table 2. Roles and Responsibilities University Administration shall provide  Endorsement of the written plan. Delegation of sufficient authority to the respective department heads involved to implement the plan. Appropriate the necessary resources required to implement the plan. Supervisors shall  Assure that the authorized individual(s) receive all necessary training to discharge their duties. Assure that all equipment necessary to protect the health and safety of the workers are provided and maintained in a good state of repair. Enforce the written control program. EHS shall  Develop a written Noise Conservation policy and perform a periodic review to determine if revisions are necessary. Monitor compliance of the respective departments  compliance with the Hearing Conservation Program. Provide guidance and technical assistance to departments in the design and selection of appropriate engineering and administrative controls. Provide guidance and technical assistance to departments in the selection of the most appropriate types and quantities of personal protective equipment. Provide consultation to the departments to assist them in fulfilling their training needs. Promote campus compliance with the OSHA Standard. Provide a means by which employees can direct suggestions, complaints, and concerns regarding the campus Hearing Conservation Program. Identify, evaluate, and make recommendations regarding those operations and locations requiring hearing protection. Employees shall  Participate willingly in all training programs offered by the University and learn as much as possible about the Hearing Conservation Program. Abide by all rules and apply to the fullest extent possible the safety and health precautions specified by the University. Report any problems that are observed, which could compromise health and safety, to the University administration through their immediate supervisor. Maintain his or her hearing protection equipment in a safe and sanitary condition and use hearing protection as required. Program elements Determination of Noise Hazards and Monitoring EHS shall conduct periodic survey of the campus to identify equipment, processes and locations that generate substantial noise.   Individuals exposed to noise levels exceeding an 8-hour, time- weighted average of 85 dBA shall be included in the Hearing Conservation Program.   A sufficient number of measurements shall be taken to account for random fluctuations in employee noise exposure. Sound level survey readings shall be taken to document the findings.   In some cases, it may be necessary to use dosimetry to determine the individual s noise exposure. Noise levels shall be checked (monitored) periodically.   The frequency of monitoring shall be determined by EHS.   Any individual in the University community may request a sound level survey. Impact Noise Impact or impulsive noise is defined as noise that reaches a maximum at an interval exceeding one second in duration. The maximum permit impact noise is 140 dBA. The following table shall be used to determine the permissible level of impact noise. Sound Level (dB) Permitted Number of Impact or Impulses Per Day 140 100 130 1000 120 10000 Controls Personal protective equipment is considered the last choice with respect to controlling an employee s exposure to a noise source.   This fact is based on low employee acceptable and improper use of personal protective equipment.   It may be necessary to use several control methods in combination to assure workers  health.   Hearing protectors may be used to prevent noise exposure while engineering or administrative controls are being developed.   The following controls are arranged in descending order, with the first being the preferred method of control. Engineering controls are the best choice, when feasible, for dealing with an occupational hazard. The first control to consider regarding a noise sources is elimination of the source. Other engineering controls include equipment that produces lower sound level pressure, shielding or enclosure of equipment. The second control method is known as administrative controls, which are also known as work practices. Examples of this control method involves rotation of workers, providing greater distance between the worker and the noise source, using less power or pressure to accomplish the task. The third control method is personal protective equipment. Personal protective equipment can take the form of ear plugs, ear muffs, helmets or circumaural protectors.   Some personal protective equipment uses active noise attenuation which is based on generation of a pressure wave that is 180 degrees out of phase with the noise source. Selection of Hearing Protectors The type(s) of hearing protection used by the employee shall reduce the sound level pressure to an 8-hour, time-weighted average of 85 dbA or less.   All hearing protection has a noise reduction rating (NRR) which is expressed in decibels.   These ratings were developed under laboratory conditions and do not represent actual use.   The measurement of the effectiveness of the hearing protector varies based on whether the A-scale or C-scale is used and whether dosimetry or area exposures are measured.   Consult EHS with regards to the field or adjusted NRR. Employees shall be offered several different types of hearing protectors (e.g. plugs, muffs) that meet the necessary sound level attenuation. Care, Maintenance and Storage of Hearing Protectors Employee exposed to excessive noise shall be furnished with hearing protection.   The University shall provide all necessary hearing protection at no cost to employees.   Hearing protectors shall be inspected by the employee before each use for damaged, worn, or missing parts.   Hearing protection devices shall be kept in good repair or replaced if unserviceable. Audiometric Testing Each employee exposed to noise levels in excess of 85 dBA (8-hour average) shall be offered an audiometric test. Employees shall be tested within six months of the date of their initial exposure to a time weighted average of 85 dBA or higher.   Tests shall be preceded by at least 14 hours without exposure to noise (work or non-work related). Retesting shall be offered annually. All testing shall be offered the employee at no charge.   The initial test shall serve as a baseline against which all subsequent tests are compared.   The test shall be administered and reviewed by an individual(s) meeting the requirements set forth in 29 CFR 1910.95. The effects of non-occupational noise exposure, age, disease, and drugs shall be considered during evaluation of the audiograms. Training and Information Employee Training Employees shall be trained in hearing conservation.   Refresher training shall be conducted on an annual basis.   The following training requirements were taken from OSHA and ANSI and must be covered during training  Noise hazards and the effects on hearing. Engineering and administrative controls being used and the need for hearing protectors. Reasons for selecting a particular type of control. The function, capabilities, and limitations of the selected hearing protector. The proper fitting of the hearing protector. Maintenance, inspection, and storage or hearing protectors. The University s program for hearing conservation and The purpose of audiometric testing. Acceptable sources of training include courses offered through Environmental Health and Safety, and other courses offered outside the University.   Records shall be kept on employees who have been trained in the hearing conservation program. Recordkeeping Listed below are various records that must be maintained under the hearing conservation program. Record Location where record is kept Minimum length of record retention Audiometric testing Department 40 years Employee training Department 3 years Medical opinion Department 40 years Sound level measurements     dosimetry and surveys EHS 10 years Sound level meter calibration EHS 3 years The medical opinion and audiometric testing are considered medical records and shall be kept secure by the employee   s department or by EHS. Records may be kept in paper or electronic form. Employee Notification Employees shall be notified, either verbally or in writing, when their noise exposure exceeds a time-weighted average of 85 dBA. Each employee who has experienced a standard threshold shift shall be notified in writing within 21 days of the date of determination.   A standard threshold shift shall be defined as an average hearing loss of 10 dBA at 2,000, 3,000, and 4,000 Hz. Off-site Noise Hazards Members of the university community shall be covered by this plan when noise hazards are encountered off site.   It shall be the responsibility of the dean, director, department head or immediate supervisor to identify employees and students, under their supervision, who may be exposed to high noise levels.   EHS is available to assist departments manage off-site hearing conservation programs. Examples of such locations include hand gun certification for University police officers and graduate students  field practice in various industries.

Scope and Applicability This document applies to all students, staff, and faculty on the Knoxville campus of the University of Tennessee, who may be subject to all heat related illnesses defined in the definitions section below. Abbreviations and Definitions Abbreviations ACGIH  American Conference of Industrial Hygienists EHS  Environmental Health and Safety OSHA  Occupational Health and Safety Administration Definitions Heat Cramps  Painful muscle spasms, as a result of exposure to excess heat. This occurs when a worker drinks a lot of water, but does not replace salts lost from sweating. Heat Syncope  Weakness, fatigue and fainting due to loss of salt and water in sweat and exercise in the heat. Heat Exhaustion  A condition usually caused by loss of body water because of exposure to excess heat. Symptoms include headache, tiredness, nausea, and sometimes fainting. Heat Rash  skin irritation caused by excessive sweating during hot, humid weather. Heat Stress  Relative amount of thermal strain from the environment. Heat Stroke  A serious disorder resulting from exposure to excess heat. It results from sweat suppression and increased storage of body heat. Symptoms include hot dry skin, high temperature, mental confusion, convulsions, and coma. Heatstroke is fatal if not treated properly. Natural wet bulb (NWB)  temperature is measured by exposing a wet sensor, such as a wet cotton wick fitted over the bulb of a thermometer, to the effects of evaporation and convection. The term natural refers to the movement of air around the sensor. Roles and Responsibilities EHS  Assist supervisors with providing annual training to employees who work in hot conditions. Ensure the Heat Stress policy is being followed and revise periodically. Assist supervisors in determining appropriate engineering and administrative controls in minimizing heat load on employees. Provide training to employees on heat risk exposure and heat related illnesses if requested by departments. Upon request, can evaluate the workplace for heat stress risk and recommend ways to manage exposure to heat. Investigate any accidents that occur as a result of heat-related illnesses. Supervisors  Recognize heat stress and risk factors. Provide fluid replacement for employees working under hot conditions. Identify specific areas in which workers are exposed to or likely to experience significantly hot environments. Determine tasks and activities that require extensive physical activity in hot environments. Identify those workers whose job duties place them at risk for suffering a heat-related illness. Identify personal protective equipment or specialized clothing that may increase the heat load on workers. Review the use of engineering controls such as ventilation systems, cool rest areas, or other items in place at your facility that can reduce the heat load on workers. Review the use of work practice controls such as periodic rest breaks, work scheduling, or other practices that can reduce the heat load on workers Provide training for all employees who work under hot conditions. Employees  Participate in heat stress training and learn the signs and symptoms of heat stress, as well as risk factors. Follow all instructions given to reduce risk of heat-related injury. Monitor themselves and coworkers for signs of heat-related illnesses. Promptly report any known or suspected unsafe conditions, or unsafe procedures to the supervisor. Procedures Heat related illnesses are influenced by several factors, such as  climate and environmental conditions, demands of the work, clothing and personal characteristics. Environmental factors include air temperature, air movement, humidity and radiant heat.   Personal characteristics include such factors as age, weight, gender, fitness level, medical condition(s), metabolic heat, diseases, water and salt balance, and medication the employees are taking. A study conducted by NIOSH links the signs of heat stress to an increase in workplace accidents. The human body regulates high temperatures by two primary mechanisms  blood flow and sweating. Blood is circulated to the skin, increasing the skin temperature and allowing the body to give off the excess heat through the skin. Sweating occurs when the body senses the heat loss due to increased blood circulation is not enough to cool the body. Evaporation of the sweat cools the skin and eliminates large quantities of heat from the body. If the body is unable to release excess heat, it will store it. When this happens, the body s core temperature rises and the heart rate increases. If the body continues to store heat the person may begin to have difficulty concentrating, may become irritable and lose the desire to drink. The next stage is often fainting which would signal a medical emergency. Listed in Table 1 are the common heat disorders with the accompanying symptoms and appropriate first aid measures. Table 1  The table below illustrates some of the signs and symptoms associated with heat stress. If an employee experiences any of these symptoms, they should be taken for medical treatment immediately. Condition Signs Symptoms First Aid Heat Cramps Painful muscle spasms Heavy sweating Increase Water intake Rest in shade cool environment Heat Syncope Brief fainting Blurred vision Increase Water intake Rest in shade cool environment Dehydration Fatigue Reduced movement Increase Water intake Rest in shade cool environment Heat Exhaustion Pale and clammy skin Possible fainting Weakness, fatigue Nausea Dizziness Heavy sweating Blurred vision Body temp slightly elevated Lie down in cool environment Water intake Loosen clothing Call 911 if symptoms continue once in cool environment. Heat Stroke Cessation of sweating Skin hot and dry Red face High body temperature Unconsciousness Collapse Convulsions Confusion or erratic behavior Life threatening condition Medical Emergency! Call University Police to summon ambulance Move Victim to shade, immerse in water Control of Heat Stress  The following engineering and administrative controls should be followed to prevent heat-related disorders  Engineering Controls  Heat may be controlled through general ventilation and spot cooling by local exhaust ventilation at the point of high heat production. Shielding may be needed for protection against radiant heat sources. Other control measures include opening windows or using fans to create airflow. Outdoor work areas need to have a shaded area accessible to the employees. Shaded areas can be created by using tarps or canopies or equipping tractors with canopies or cabs. Acclimatization  Employees need to adapt to new temperatures. This adaptation period is usually 5 days. New employees and employees returning from an absence of two weeks or more should have a 3-5 day period of acclimatization. This period should begin with 50% of the normal workload the first day and gradually build up to 100% on the last day. Weather Conditions  Check weather conditions frequently during the day and adjust the work schedule. It might be appropriate to change the actual hours of work to minimize working during the heat of the summer months. Heavy work should be scheduled for the cooler hours of the day. Non-essential tasks should be postponed when there is a heat warning issued. Work Rest Cycles  Heavy and minimal work activities should be alternated. Tasks should be rotated among workers. Employees should be allowed sufficient breaks in a cool area to avoid heat strain and promote recovery. Shade or an air-conditioned break room should be provided. Personal Protective Equipment  During work in hot environments, workers should use the lightest weight or    breathable    protective garments that give adequate protection. This may include the wearing of shorts if this does not create a hazard for the legs. The clothing should be light colored. For work in extremely hot environments, cool vests are available from several manufacturers. These vests typically provide 1-2 hours of cooling, recharge in 20 minutes, and maintain a constant temperature of 55  F. Fluid Intake  Fluids, such as water or electrolyte replacement drinks (i.e. Gatorade), need to be conveniently available to workers so they can drink about 8 oz. of liquids every 20 minutes. The ideal temperature for liquids should be 50  F- 60  F. For remote outdoor work locations, this means providing a cooler of liquids and ice that the workers can transport with them to the location. Alcohol, coffee, tea, and caffeinated sodas should be avoided, since these increase dehydration and interferes with heat loss. Other Administrative Controls  The following administrative controls can be used to reduce heat stress  Reduce the physical demands of work, e.g., excessive lifting or digging with heavy objects Provide recovery areas, e.g., air-conditioned enclosures and rooms Use shifts, e.g., early morning, cool part of the day, or night work Use intermittent rest periods with water breaks Use relief workers and use the buddy system Slow down pace of work, if needed Assign extra workers and limit worker occupancy, or the number of workers present, especially in confined or enclosed spaces. Consider a worker s physical condition when determining fitness to work in hot environments. Taking certain medications, lack of conditioning, obesity, pregnancy, and inadequate rest can increase susceptibility to heat stress. Measuring Burden of Heat on Workers  Every worker who works in extraordinary conditions that increase the risk of heat stress should be personally monitored. These conditions include wearing semi permeable or impermeable clothing when the temperature exceeds 21  C (69.8  F), working at extreme metabolic loads (greater than 500 kcal hour), etc. Personal monitoring can be done by checking the heart rate, recovery heart rate, oral temperature, or extent of body water loss. Heart rate is one of the most reliable indices of heat stress. The heart rate of a worker encompasses the combined demands of work level, body temperature elevation, environmental heat, and cardiovascular fitness. Heat rate increases disproportionately with heat load. A heart rate of 180 to 200 beats per minute is the maximum capacity for adults. A good rule of thumb is as follows  count the pulse rate for the last 30 seconds of the first three minutes after rest begins. If the first pulse (measured for 30-60 second) is maintained at 110 beats per minute, no increasing stress has occurred as the work progresses. If the pulse rate is higher, than 110 beats per minute after measuring the pulse during this period, then there is a possibility that the employee is experiencing some heat stress. Oral temperature can be checked with a clinical thermometer after work but before the employee drinks water. If the oral temperature taken under the tongue exceeds 37.6  C, shorten the next work cycle by one third. Body water loss can be measured by weighing the worker on a scale at the beginning and end of each work day. The worker s weight loss should not exceed 1.5% of total body weight in a work day. If a weight loss exceeding this amount is observed, fluid intake should increase. Measuring the Environment*  EHS can use a WBGT (wet bulb globe thermometer) to access heat stress, using the following equation  WBGT = 0.7NWB + 0.3GT Outdoors with solar load WBGT = 0.7NWB + 0.2GT + 0.1DB Where  WBGT = Wet Bulb Globe Temperature Index NWB = Natural Wet-Bulb Temperature DB = Dry-Bulb (air) Temperature GT = Globe Thermometer Temperature The determination of WBGT requires the use of a black globe thermometer, a natural (static) wet-bulb thermometer, and a dry-bulb thermometer. The measurement of environmental factors shall be performed as follows  The range of the dry and the natural wet-bulb thermometers should be -5  C to +50  C, with an accuracy of   0.5  C. The dry bulb thermometer must be shielded from the sun and the other radiant surfaces of the environment without restricting the airflow around the bulb. The wick of the natural wet bulb thermometer should be kept wet with distilled water for at least one-half hour before the temperature reading is made. It is not enough to immerse the other end of the wick into a reservoir of distilled water and wait until the whole wick becomes wet by capillarity. The wick must be wetted by direct application of water from a syringe one-half hour before each reading. The wick must cover the bulb of the thermometer and an equal length of additional wick must cover the stem above the bulb. The wick should always be clean, and new wicks should be washed before using. A globe thermometer, consisting of a 15 cm (6-inch) in diameter hollow copper sphere painted on the outside with a matte black finish, or equivalent, must be used. The bulb or sensor of a thermometer (range -5  C to +100  C with an accuracy of   0.5  C) must be fixed in the center of the sphere. The globe thermometer should be exposed at least 25 minutes before it is read. A stand should be used to suspend the three thermometers so that they do not restrict free air flow around the bulbs and the wet-bulb and globe thermometer are not shaded. It is permissible to use any other type of temperature sensor that gives a reading similar to that of a mercury thermometer under the same conditions. The thermometers must be placed so that the readings are representative of the employee s work or rest areas, as appropriate. Once the WBGT has been estimated, EHS can estimate workers  metabolic heat load and use the ACGIH method to determine the appropriate work rest regimen, clothing, and equipment needed to control the heat exposures of workers in their facilities. *Taken from OSHA Technical Manual on Heat Stress Recordkeeping EHS and departments will maintain a copy of all training records for a minimum of three years. Any medical records concerning heat stress related injuries at the workplace will be maintained indefinitely by the affected departments. Training and Information After completing Heat Stress training, employees should understand  The seriousness and prevalence of heat stress How the body   s internal cooling system handles heat How hot environments increase the likelihood of accidents How and why the body   s internal cooling mechanisms may fail The types of heat-related illness they or co-workers most likely face on the job, including their causes, common symptoms and treatment first aid The environmental factors (such as air temperature, radiant heat, humidity and air movement) in a given work area which should cause heightened alert for signs of heat illness The work-related factors that increase the risk of heat-related illness (such as type of work, level of physical exertion required, duration of activity and required protective clothing or gear) Unique personal factors (such as age, weight, alcohol caffeine use, history of heat-related illness, etc.) that can put them at increased risk Basic preventative measures workers can take to reduce the risk of heat stress Disclaimer The information provided in these guidelines is designed for educational use only and is not a substitute for specific training or experience.

Effective Date  07 01 2014 Revision Date  04 27 2018 jump to appendices and forms   highlight  Purpose The acquisition, use and disposal of controlled substances in the state of Tennessee are strictly regulated by the Tennessee State Board of Pharmacy and the United States Department of Justice Drug Enforcement Administration (US DEA). These regulations are intended to prevent diversion of controlled substances. The purpose of this document is to ensure that researchers planning work with controlled substances are aware of and understand their responsibility for complying with the relevant state and federal statutes and regulations governing the use of these substances. Scope and Applicability This document applies to the use of controlled substances in research conducted under the auspices of the University of Tennessee Knoxville campus (the    University   ), including all in vivo research under IACUC-approved protocols and in vitro research. Any individual who uses or synthesizes controlled substances for research under the auspices of the University must be  (a) licensed with the Tennessee State Board of Pharmacy and registered with the US DEA (a    Licensed Individual   ) to conduct such research  or (b) authorized under the license of a Licensed Individual with respect to such research. The University does not hold an    institutional license    for use of controlled substances in research.   Even if an individual already has a practitioner   s (clinical) license and DEA registration for treatment of patients with controlled substances, if he or she will also be conducting laboratory or non-therapeutic research involving controlled substances, a separate research license from the Tennessee State Board of Pharmacy is required.   In addition, for research with Schedule I a drug, a separate registration with the DEA is required. Abbreviations and Definitions Abbreviations DEA  U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration PI  Principal Investigator Definitions Controlled Substance  Controlled substances are drugs that are regulated by state and federal laws that aim to control the danger of addiction, abuse, physical and mental harm, the trafficking by illegal means, and the dangers from actions of those who have used the substances. Such drugs may be declared illegal for sale or use, but may be dispensed under a physician s prescription. The Controlled Substances Act (CSA), Title II of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, is the legal foundation of the federal government s fight against the abuse of drugs and other substances. This law is a consolidation of numerous laws regulating the manufacture and distribution of narcotics, stimulants, depressants, hallucinogens, anabolic steroids, and chemicals used in the illicit production of controlled substances. Licensed Individual  the person ultimately responsible for controlled substance research compliance. Typically, the Licensed Individual is the Principal Investigator of a research protocol. Other Authorized Individual      a member of the Licensed Individual   s staff authorized to work with controlled substances under the Licensed Individual   s license registration Roles and Responsibilities Licensed Individual The responsibility for controlled substance research compliance rests with the Licensed Individual. Typically, the Licensed Individual is the Principal Investigator of a research protocol. The Licensed Individual is responsible for obtaining and renewing both the DEA registration and the TN State Board of Pharmacy license and for assuring that all acquisition, storage, security, inventory, disposal and record-keeping requirements are met. Other Authorized Individual The Licensed Individual may authorize members of his or her staff to work with controlled substances under the Licensed Individual   s license registration (   Other Authorized Individuals   ). However, the Licensed Individual retains overall responsibility for meeting all regulatory requirements. Other Authorized Individuals must be listed on the Licensed Individual   s controlled substance protocol submitted with the license application, as set forth in section D(1)(b)(ii) above. Licensed Individuals may not name as Other Authorized Individuals any person who  (i) has been convicted of a felony offense relating to controlled substances  or (ii) at any time, has had an application for registration with the DEA denied, a DEA registration revoked or has surrendered a DEA registration for cause. The Office of Research The Office of Research staff will be responsible to aid all researchers and PIs maintain compliance with the program through training sessions, guidelines, consultations and inspections.   The Office of Research staff will also escort the DEA inspectors during their inspections of labs and act as a liaison between the inspectors and the PI or lab staff. Procedures Drug Schedules Drugs, substances, and certain chemicals used to make drugs are classified by the DEA into five (5) distinct categories or schedules depending upon the drug   s acceptable medical use and the drug   s abuse or dependency potential. The abuse rate is a determinate factor in the scheduling of the drug  for example, Schedule I drugs are considered the most dangerous class of drugs with a high potential for abuse and potentially severe psychological and or physical dependence. As the drug schedule changes-- Schedule II, Schedule III, etc., so does the abuse potential-- Schedule V drugs represents the least potential for abuse. A Listing of drugs and their schedule are located at Controlled Substance Act (CSA) Scheduling or CSA Scheduling by Alphabetical Order. These lists describes the basic or parent chemical and do not necessarily describe the salts, isomers and salts of isomers, esters, ethers and derivatives which may also be classified as controlled substances. These lists are intended as general references and are not comprehensive listings of all controlled substances. Please note that a substance need not be listed as a controlled substance to be treated as a Schedule I substance for criminal prosecution. A controlled substance analogue is a substance which is intended for human consumption and is structurally or pharmacologically substantially similar to or is represented as being similar to a Schedule I or Schedule II substance and is not an approved medication in the United States. (See 21 U.S.C.   802(32)(A) for the definition of a controlled substance analogue and 21 U.S.C.   813 for the schedule.) Schedule I Schedule I drugs, substances, or chemicals are defined as drugs with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse. Schedule I drugs are the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially severe psychological or physical dependence. Some examples of Schedule I drugs are  heroin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), marijuana (cannabis), 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy), methaqualone, and peyote Schedule II Schedule II drugs, substances, or chemicals are defined as drugs with a high potential for abuse, less abuse potential than Schedule I drugs, with use potentially leading to severe psychological or physical dependence. These drugs are also considered dangerous. Some examples of Schedule II drugs are  cocaine, methamphetamine, methadone, hydromorphone (Dilaudid), meperidine (Demerol), oxycodone (OxyContin), fentanyl, Dexedrine, Adderall, and Ritalin Schedule III Schedule III drugs, substances, or chemicals are defined as drugs with a moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence. Schedule III drugs abuse potential is less than Schedule I and Schedule II drugs but more than Schedule IV. Some examples of Schedule III drugs are  Combination products with less than 15 milligrams of hydrocodone per dosage unit (Vicodin), Products containing less than 90 milligrams of codeine per dosage unit (Tylenol with codeine), ketamine, anabolic steroids, testosterone Schedule IV Schedule IV drugs, substances, or chemicals are defined as drugs with a low potential for abuse and low risk of dependence. Some examples of Schedule IV drugs are  Xanax, Soma, Darvon, Darvocet, Valium, Ativan, Talwin, Ambien Schedule V Schedule V drugs, substances, or chemicals are defined as drugs with lower potential for abuse than Schedule IV and consist of preparations containing limited quantities of certain narcotics. Schedule V drugs are generally used for antidiarrheal, antitussive, and analgesic purposes. Some examples of Schedule V drugs are  cough preparations with less than 200 milligrams of codeine or per 100 milliliters (Robitussin AC), Lomotil, Motofen, Lyrica, Parepectolin Some of the controlled substances used in research and their schedule numbers and DEA codes are  Substance Schedule Narcotic? DEA Code Ketamine III N 7285 Pentobarbital (e.g., Nembutal) II N 2270 Buprenorphine III Y 9064 Fentanyl II Y 9801 Diazepam IV N 2765 Pentobarbital & non-controlled active ingredients (e.g., B-Euthanasia) III N 2271 A complete list of DEA controlled substances is found at  http   www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov schedules orangebook c_cs_alpha.pdf Researcher Licensing and Registration Authorization for acquisition of controlled substances for research is a two-step process  (a) licensing with the Tennessee State Board of Pharmacy  and (b) registration with the US DEA. Controlled Substances Licensure Authorizations are required prior to the use of controlled substances in animals. To obtain and use controlled substances such as certain common analgesics or anesthetics (e.g., buprenorphine, ketamine, pentobarbital) it is necessary to have appropriate federal Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) registration, which in turn requires prior licensure by the Tennessee State Board of Pharmacy. To initiate the process, download and complete the state form (available at https   www.tn.gov content dam tn health documents Researcher_Application.01-2017.pdf This will require a concise description of the planned research use of the drug, a plan for secure storage, as well as payment of a fee. Once a state license number has been obtained the federal registration can be initiated (http   www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov drugreg reg_apps index.html). In the Tennessee Legend Drug and Controlled Substance Research Act of 1984 (See 53-14-104 License Required Application Fees) it states (a) No person shall manufacture, obtain, possess, administer or dispense a legend drug or controlled substance for the purpose of scientific research, chemical analysis, instruction or training of detection animals without having first secured a license to do so from the director. This means that even if a physician investigator maintains appropriate licensure for controlled substances used in his her medical practice, (s)he must obtain research licensure from the Tennessee State Board of Pharmacy to use these substances in research involving animals and or must modify his her state license to include the use of controlled substances in the research setting. Clinical Researchers Obtaining Controlled Substance for Use in Research Some clinicians may be using their practice license to secure controlled substances for research purposes. All personnel responsible for procuring control substances for research purposes must obtain researcher licensure from the State Board of Pharmacy. Non-clinical research personnel are already required to obtain State licensure before obtaining controlled substances for use in research.

Exemption from chapter. - This chapter shall not apply to  A licensed physician, dentist or veterinarian lawfully administering, dispensing or prescribing a legend drug or controlled substance in the course of the individual s professional practice to an ultimate user for a recognized medical purpose  or A manufacturer or distributor whose research protocol has been approved by the federal food and drug administration under that agency s auspices, or otherwise subject to jurisdiction of the federal food and drug administration and if lawful under that jurisdiction.  Acts 1984, ch. 717,    2.  US DEA registration The US DEA registration requires inclusion of the licensee   s state license number and identification of the controlled substances used. Note that for work with Schedule I substances, applicants must attach three copies of a more detailed Schedule I Controlled Substance Protocol. A Schedule I Controlled Substance Protocol template is attached as Appendix B. The registration application, DEA Form 225, is available at https   www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov drugreg reg_apps 225 225_form.pdf . Registration procedures, including detailed instructions on form submission, are available here  http   www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov drugreg process.htm. Persons who are already registered with DEA as a medical practitioner are not required to obtain an additional DEA registration for research involving any drug in Schedules II-V if this clinical registration is being actively used to prescribe drugs to patients. For any research involving Schedule I drugs, a researcher   s registration (DEA Form225) is required for all researchers, including medical practitioners who are already registered with DEA. Upon receipt of a registration application, the DEA may schedule a telephone interview or an on-site inspection. New registrants must complete their initial inventory of controlled substances immediately upon receipt of their DEA registration, on the first day of business after registration. See Section H(4). In most cases, this initial inventory will show zero quantities. DEA registration must be renewed annually, except for the practitioner   s (clinical) registration described in paragraph (b) above, which must be renewed every three years. Procurement of Controlled Substances Purchasing may require additional information from the registrant in the case of initial orders and amendments to initial orders for use of controlled substances in research (see 21 CFR 1301.18 and 1301.32).   For Schedule I and II drugs, the request will include a completed DEA form 222. Registrants may only order purchase controlled substances within a given class specified on their registration.   For example, if the registrant is approved for the use purchase of schedule II non-narcotic drugs (e.g. Nembutal) that does mean that he she can also purchase a schedule II narcotic drug (e.g. Fentanyl) not specified on the DEA application.   The registrant would need to go through the DEA and the TN State Board of Pharmacy first to get this approved.   Registrant must verify the accuracy of a shipment of Controlled Substances from a supplier immediately upon receipt. Discrepancies must be reported to the DEA, UT Police, the Office of Research, and the supplier upon discovery. Payment of Fees It is the responsibility of the registrant to pay any required registration and licensure fees.   Current information on the fee for annual renewal of the DEA registration is found at http   www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov drugreg categories.htm In addition, the registrant will be responsible for paying any disposal fees associated with discarding controlled substances. Storage and Security  Controlled substances shall at all times be properly safeguarded and securely kept at the address on file with the DEA and which corresponds with the information indicated in the ordering of the controlled substances. Adequate security and storage must be provided and access to such storage must be limited to Licensed and or Other Authorized Individuals. Security requirements vary depending on  (1) whether the storage is for working stocks or reserve or main stocks  and (2) the schedule of controlled substance. Working Stocks     appropriate for most individually licensed Principal Investigators. Schedule I-IV controlled substances shall be kept in stationary (typically built in a wall), locked double cabinets. Both cabinets must have key-locked doors with separate keys  spring locks or combination locks are not acceptable. Schedule V controlled substances shall be stored in a stationary, securely locked cabinet of substantial construction. Reserve or main stocks     generally restricted to activities carried out under institutional licenses or when more than one Principal Investigator will ultimately receive the material. Schedule I and II controlled substances shall be stored in a GSA class 5 rated steel cabinet or equivalent safe approved by the DEA. Any cabinet or safe weighing less than 750 pounds shall be bolted or cemented to the floor or wall in such a way that it cannot be removed. The door of the cabinet or safe shall contain a multiple position combination lock, a relocking device or the equivalent, and steel plate having a thickness of at least one-half inch. Schedule III, IV and V controlled substances shall be stored in a securely locked cabinet of substantial construction. Reporting Loss, Theft, or Unauthorized Use Each incident or alleged incident of possible theft, loss or diversion of a controlled substance must be immediately reported to the Licensed Individual and to UT Police.   Thereafter, the Licensed Individual must promptly report the incident to the TN State Board of Pharmacy. Finally, the Licensed Individual must report to DEA the theft or significant loss of any controlled substances within one business day of discovery. Each agency has its own form that must be used for this reporting. Links to the forms are available at https   www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov 21cfr_reports theft index.html Authorizing Other Users The registrant may request that additional UT employees who are supervised by the registrant (within the same department and registered physical location) be authorized to use the substances for approved activities.   The registrant must first screen these employees prior to authorization, as described at 21 CFR 1301.90.   The registrant should maintain a log book of who has access to controlled substances in their lab, and the substances and amounts used. Spills Breakage, spills, or other witnessed controlled substance losses do not need to be reported as lost.   This type of loss must be documented by the registrant and witness on the inventory record.   Controlled substances that can be recovered after a spill, but cannot be used because of contamination (tablets), must be placed in the disposal destruction waste stream (Completion of DEA Form 41 required).   If the spilled controlled substance is not recoverable (liquids)  the registrant must document the circumstances in their inventory records and the witnesses must sign. Training and Information The University requires all Licensed Individuals and Other Authorized Individuals to complete an initial Controlled Substances Acquisition, Use and Disposal training. The training must be renewed triennially. The Office of Research will oversee the training development and delivery of this program. Recordkeeping The controlled substances regulations require significant record keeping at every point, including initial receipt, use, and disposal. The licensed individual is responsible for maintaining this documentation with respect to controlled substances used for his or her research. The records must be easily produced in the event of an inspection by the TN State Board of Pharmacy, or the DEA.   All signatures in the Inventory and records must be legible and dated. Initial receipt documentation An initial inventory shall include  Whether the inventory was taken at the beginning or close of business  The name of the substance  Each finished form of the substance (e.g., 10-milligram tablet or 10-milligram concentration per fluid ounce or milliliter)  The number of units or volume of each finished form in each commercial container (e.g., 100-tablet bottle or 3-milliliter vial)  and The number of commercial containers of each such finished form (e.g. four 100-tablet bottles or six 3-milliliter vials). Damaged, defective, expired, or impure substances awaiting disposal must also be inventoried including name, total quantity, and the reason why the substance is being maintained. In determining the number of units of a controlled substance in a commercial container that has been opened, the registrant shall, if the substance is listed in Schedule I or II, make an exact count or measure of the contents.   If the substance is listed in Schedule III, IV or V, the registrant may make an estimated count or measure of the contents, unless the container holds more than 1,000 tablets or capsules in which case he she must make an exact count of the contents. After the initial inventory, a new inventory must be taken by the registrant at least every two years.   The biennial inventory date must be within two years of the last inventory. Initial and biennial inventories must be maintained by each registrant and kept at the location where the substances are stored.   Initial and biennial inventories must be kept for two years from the date the inventory was conducted. It is the registrant   s responsibility to ensure that databases are up to date. As far as the DEA is concerned, the registrant, not the institution, is solely responsible for ensuring that any rules and regulation pertaining to the use of controlled substances are implemented. Use Documentation Use documentation must include the name of the Licensed Individual, the date, type and quantity of drug and signature of the Licensed Individual or Other Authorized Individual using the controlled substance. In addition, such records shall include the following information for each controlled substance  Name of substance. Each finished form (such as 10 mg. tablet, or 10 mg. concentration per fluid ounce or milliliter) and the number of units or volume of finished form in each commercial container. The number of commercial containers of such finished form received from other persons, including the date of and number of containers in each receipt, and the name, address, and registration number of the person from whom the containers were received. The amount of such finished form dispensed, including the name and address of the person to whom it was dispensed, the date of dispensing, and the written or typewritten name or initials of the individual who dispensed or administered the substance. The number of units or volume of the finished form and or commercial containers disposed of in any other manner by the researcher, including the date and manner of disposal. Biennial Inventory Documentation An inventory of the stock of controlled substances at all locations where controlled substances are present must be recorded on the day after the DEA registration is received, when research with possession of controlled substances begins and then biennially thereafter. The inventory must specify whether it was taken at the open or close of business on that day. A separate entry must be made with respect to each kind of substance or preparation, and each kind or size of package. Each entry shall show the name, quantity and content of controlled substance and the size of the individual package, the number of packages and the total content of all packages covered by the entry on hand as of the date of the inventory. This biennial inventory must be retained on file with other controlled substances records. Record Retention All controlled substance records shall be readily available and maintained at the premises where the licensed activity is conducted. Inventories and records of controlled substances listed in Schedules I and II, including DEA Form 222, shall be maintained separately from other controlled substance records of the Licensed Individual. All records must be maintained by Licensed Individuals for a period of at least five years from the date of the last recorded purchase, transfer, use, or other transaction involving the controlled substance. Disposal and Transfer of Controlled Substances Inventories Licensed individuals are responsible for documenting the disposal of controlled substances. Registrants leaving UT must notify the Office of Research 30 days prior to their termination of employment so that records can be reconciled and unused controlled substances can be disposed of properly or transferred in a timely manner to the inventory of another licensed individual at UT. If one licensed individual transfers Controlled Substances to another licensed individual, the transfer must be documented to the Office of Research and all inventory records and other records pertaining to the inventory must be transferred to the next licensed individual responsible for the controlled substances. In the event of death or extended absence of a licensed individual, the licensed individual supervisor must notify the Office of Research, which will either arrange for disposal of them, or work with the Registrant   s school to arrange for another Registrant to assume responsibility for them. Diversion, Theft or Loss of Controlled Substances Anyone having knowledge or reasonable suspicion of inventory irregularities or diversion, theft or loss of controlled substances from a registered location or other site has an obligation to report such information to UT Police, the Office Research, and the licensed individual (if the licensed individual is not the person reporting). The licensed individual shall notify the DEA Field Division Office of any theft or significant diversion or loss of any controlled substances upon discovery of the theft, loss, or diversion. Oversight The Office of Research will review each licensed individual   s management of controlled substances and compliance with this policy at least once every 12 months.   More frequent reviews are at the Office of Research discretion. More frequent reviews may be initiated due to concerns about compliance with this policy and the law, and also may be requested by a licensed individual, or a licensed individual   s supervisor, department head or dean, if there are concerns about compliance with this policy. Disposal Licensed Individuals should make every effort to limit the amount of controlled substances requiring disposal by monitoring expiration dates and ensuring use of controlled substances within the appropriate timeframe, as well as limiting purchase storage of controlled substances to appropriate quantities (e.g., sufficient to support the equivalent of 3-months of research). Disposal and or surrender of controlled substances must be in accordance with applicable laws and regulations If controlled substances expire or otherwise require disposal, the Licensed Individual should contact a Reverse Distributor and arrange for the documented return of the controlled substances through a reverse distribution process. When controlled substances cannot be surrendered to a Reverse Distributor, the Licensed Individual must seek permission from the DEA to destroy on-site. In addition, in accordance with 21 C.F.R.    1307.21, DEA Form 41 must be filed. DEA Form 41 is an on-line form that may be completed at http   www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov 21cfr_reports surrend index.html. Controlled substances may be destroyed on-site or surrendered only with the permission of DEA and in accordance with their respective regulations. All controlled substances must remain securely stored in accordance with the    Storage    section of this Policy while awaiting DEA approval for disposal. If controlled substances are discovered for which registration cannot be ascertained, please contact the Office of Research for guidance. Any person disposing of a controlled substance must maintain written records containing  Date of return or destruction  Name, form, quantity of the substance returned or destroyed  Name, address, registry number of the person making the return  Name, address, registry number of the supplier or manufacturer to whom the substances are returned or the name and license number of the persons performing and witnessing the destruction. Abandonment Under no circumstances are controlled substances to be abandoned by a registrant.   However, occasionally, licensed individuals will leave without appropriately disposing or transferring all controlled substances from their lab or other location.   Under these circumstances, the department or unit head responsible for that location will, in lieu of the registrant, need to follow the procedure outlined under    Disposal    above.

Trainees must successfully complete hands-on training and a hands-on evaluation before being allowed to operate an aerial scissor lift independently. Trainees will be given adequate supervision and time to learn basic operating skills. Initial operator hands-on evaluations must be completed using the checklist found in Appendix D or equivalent. Documented re-evaluation of each aerial scissor lift operator will be completed at least once every three years using Appendix D or equivalent. Re-evaluations can be conducted by an employee in the department work unit who is experienced and competent with the aerial scissor lift. This person could be a certified operator, Supervisor Manager or safety officer. Refresher training Refresher training in relevant topics will be provided to an aerial scissor lift operator when any of the following occur  The operator has been observed to be using the aerial scissor lift in an unsafe manner. The operator has been involved in an accident or a near-miss incident. The operator has received an evaluation that reveals the operator is not using the aerial scissor lift safely. The operator is assigned to operate a different type of equipment. A condition in the workplace changes in a manner that could affect safe operation of the equipment. Maintenance The manufacturer   s instructions regarding maintenance must be followed. (Such instructions are typically included in the owner   s manual for the aerial scissor lifts). An annual inspection is required and must be conducted by an authorized person qualified as a mechanic on the type of aerial scissor lift or one having similar design characteristics. Any aerial scissor lift with an identified safety issue will be immediately removed from service. Maintenance performed by certified aerial scissor lift operators will be limited to replacing disconnecting connecting batteries, changing fuel cylinders, adding water to batteries, replacing light bulbs and replacing stickers and decals. No aerial scissor lift with a leak in the fuel system will be operated until the leak has been eliminated. Repairs to the fuel and ignition system that involve fire hazards will be conducted in a location (non-flammable) designated for such repairs. Any aerial scissor that emits hazardous sparks or flames from the exhaust system will be immediately removed from service and not returned to service until the cause has been eliminated.

Effective Date  02 01 2018 Revision Date  02 01 2018 jump to appendices and forms   highlight  Purpose This guideline outlines the recommendations for protecting the reproductive health of all individuals on campus from occupational exposure to chemical, biological, radioactive, and other substances that are known or suspected of being capable of posing a hazard to human reproduction. Potential reproductive and developmental hazards will be identified and appropriate exposure control measures will be implemented. Scope and Applicability This shall apply to all faculty, staff and students on the Knoxville campus of the University of Tennessee. This shall apply to individuals on campus who have the potential to encounter potential reproductive hazards as part of their job responsibilities, with worker health protection and OSHA regulations in mind. Abbreviations and Definitions Abbreviations EHS  Environmental Health and Safety OSHA  Occupational Safety & Health Administration PPE  Personal Protective Equipment SDS  Safety Data Sheets Definitions Reproductive Hazard  Any chemical, physical or biological agent that is capable of impacting an individual   s ability to conceive, maintain a pregnancy or results in a birth defect. Reproductive Toxicity  Adverse effects on the health of the reproductive organs, endocrine system, or gametes (egg or sperm) from exposure to an exogenous agent. May result in effects such as  menstrual dysfunction, damage to gametes (ova or sperm) or gamete development, impaired fertility, or inability to maintain a pregnancy. Developmental Toxicity  Adverse effects on the developing organism that may occur anytime from conception to sexual maturity. Mutagen  physical or chemical agent that changes the genetic material, usually DNA, of an organism and thus increases the frequency of mutations above the natural background level. Teratogen  substances that may cause birth defects via a toxic effect on an embryo or fetus. Roles and Responsibilities Employees and Students shall At your discretion (this is a voluntary act), formally declare pregnancy or other reproductive health issues to your supervisor or instructor as soon as you become aware of it, and request a review of work or classroom assignments, if needed. Consult with a personal physician about particular circumstances and potential hazards. Take care not to expose yourself to any unnecessary chemical, biological, radioactive, or hazardous physical agents. Report all unintended or improper exposure incidents to your supervisor or instructor. Follow all recommended work practices and utilize PPE and equipment provided to decrease exposure to hazards in the work area. Comply with all university policies and OSHA requirements and regulations to assure a safe and healthful working environment. Attend all required safety training and seek additional training or information if you become aware of a reproductive health issue that applies to you. Work with supervisor to identify possible alternate job duties or temporary reassignment within the department consistent with medical restrictions. Be aware that UTK endeavors to provide information regarding relevant facts and safety regarding reproductive health. However, there are circumstances and situations that may not pose a clear threat or are not specifically identified by regulatory guidance as a reproductive threat. In these cases, you, not the university, must make the ultimate decision whether to accept a risk to you or an unborn fetus. Supervisors shall  Ensure that all employees attend required safety training. Provide employees with appropriate PPE and ensure that employees properly use PPE and other control measures. Temporarily assign duties, if needed, consistent with medical restrictions. Maintain an inventory of chemical, biological, and radiological agents used in the work area. Be familiar, and ensure that employees are familiar with the hazards associated with these agents     including reproductive or developmental hazards and develop operation-specific chemical hygiene plans or standard operating procedures (SOPs). EHS, Radiation Safety and the Biosafety Office shall  Provide onsite hazard analysis upon request and assist in determining appropriate methods to minimize exposure to within acceptable limits. Preventative measures may involve engineering or administrative controls and personal protective equipment. Appendix A includes a sample consultation form which will facilitate the onsite analysis. Provide guidance, training and assistance to involved parties regarding ways to minimize exposure to reproductive health hazards in the university environment. Provide, or arrange for, exposure testing and monitoring, as appropriate. Work with other safety offices (Radiation Safety and Biosafety) to ensure that all areas have been covered. Develop and implement UTK   s Reproductive Health Program and update the Reproductive Guideline as needed. Procedures Hierarchy of controls and general protective measures Whenever possible eliminate the hazardous material or substitute with a less hazardous or non-hazardous alternative. Using effective engineering controls, such as local exhaust ventilation, fume hoods, or biosafety cabinets. Receive training on and use safe work practices. Use the following administrative controls when engineering controls are not available Use job rotations to reduce exposures. Transfer the employee to a job which does not involve exposure to reproductive or developmental hazards, consistent with medical restrictions. Similar considerations should be made for students who may be exposed to such hazards during classes, labs, or independent research projects. Wear personal protective equipment as prescribed. Examples of personal protective equipment include, but not limited to face shields, googles, gloves, and respirator protection. Direct questions regarding reproductive risks in the work area  Chemicals  contact EHS (865-974-5084)  safety@utk.edu Biological Hazards  contact the Biosafety Office (865-974-1938)  utbiosafety@utk.edu Radiological Hazards  contact Radiation Safety (865-974-5580)  radiationsafety@utk.edu Considerations for handling hazardous chemicals Chemicals that may act as reproductive hazards may be found in laboratories, shops, art studios, pharmacies, medical facilities (e.g. operating rooms, patient care areas, etc.), and maintenance areas (e.g. custodial supply closets). A list of chemicals which may pose a reproductive hazard is provided in Appendix B, though this list should not be considered exhaustive. Chemical exposures may occur through multiple portals of entry into the body, including inhalation, ingestion, injection, and muco-cutaneous (skin & mucous membrane) absorption. Remember, the presence absence of specific odors or visual contamination is not a reliable indicator for exposure. Even if there is no detectable odor or visible residue, significant exposure may be occurring.   Therefore, preventative and protective measures must be taken. Protective measures include  Correct use of a chemical exhaust hood or other ventilation controls to limit inhalation and or mucous membrane exposures. This is critical for agents that readily release hazardous vapors into the air. Even if the agents aren   t readily released into the air, air currents, turbulence or other disturbances can cause the agent to become airborne, leading to potential exposures. Therefore, use of a chemical exhaust hood or other local ventilation device to mix or weigh potentially toxic powders is recommended. Environmental monitoring to determine the presence and relative concentration of hazardous chemicals. EHS will determine if environmental monitoring is necessary, and if so, conduct (or arrange for) monitoring. If results indicate an unacceptable risk of exposure, appropriate protective measures will be communicated. Wearing PPE. Gloves, lab coats or protective smocks, and protective eyewear limit mucous membrane and skin exposures and should always be worn when handling hazardous chemicals.   Respiratory protection may also be indicated if a chemical exhaust hood or other ventilation controls aren   t available. The extent of PPE and types makes models are determined by the types of material, exposure potential, and relative health risk.   EHS will work with staff, supervisors, and instructors to help assess and define appropriate PPE. Practicing good personal hygiene. Avoid hand-to-mouth or hand-to-face contact when working with hazardous chemicals to limit mucous membrane exposures or accidental ingestion. Always wash your hands any time you remove protective gloves, before leaving a lab work space, and or prior to eating or drinking. Additionally, do not store or consume food in lab work spaces where hazardous chemicals are stored. Practicing good lab hygiene. Ensure that chemical containers are thoroughly and accurately labeled, closed when not in use, and stored appropriately. Chemical wastes should be similarly labeled, closed, and stored. Considerations for handling biological hazards Biological hazards include  infectious agents (bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa, etc.)  toxins that may induce acute and or chronic health effects (often managed as toxic chemicals)  blood, tissues and body fluids from humans and animals  and diagnostic or environmental samples that may contain any of the above. Biological hazards may be found in laboratories, animal research facilities, and human veterinary clinics and hospitals. Areas and equipment containing biological hazards are generally marked with a universal biohazard symbol along with caution warning statements. Like chemicals, exposures to biohazards may be via muco-cutaneous exposure, ingestion, injection dermal injury, or inhalation. Biological hazards are typically microscopic (not visible) and otherwise difficult to detect. Infection or exposure to biohazards may or may not result in disease depending on the agent, level of exposure, portal of entry, and multiple host factors. If disease occurs, the onset, severity and duration of disease may be highly variable between individuals. Appendix C lists agents known (or reasonably suspected) to cause reproductive harm, mild-to-severe fetal defects which may result in miscarriage or spontaneous abortion, and or significant risk to pregnant women. This list should not be considered exhaustive. It is often difficult to tell if reproductive problems or congenital defects are caused by exposure to biological agents or some other complicating factor(s). Also, it is difficult to know what levels of exposure to infectious agents are safe for any given individual. Therefore, preventative protective measures are necessary. In addition to the general protective measures for chemicals listed above  Use engineering controls such as HEPA-filtered biological safety cabinets, sealed centrifuge rotors or safety cups, etc. Eliminate or reduce the use of sharp devices. Whenever possible, use safety-engineered sharps devices and observe sharps safety precautions. Ensure that vaccines are up-to-date, including the (inactivated) seasonal flu vaccine. Some vaccines may be contraindicated during pregnancy, so it is important to consult with a medical professional. If working in a healthcare setting, avoid working with patients who are infected with the listed agents if not vaccinated or otherwise immune. Also, patients diagnosed with unusual or emerging infections should be avoided. Follow the latest recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and or local public health agencies. Enroll in the Animal Care & Use occupational health program if working with research animals, farm animals, or in the Veterinary Teaching Hospital. Considerations for handling radiological hazards  Radiological hazards may be found in laboratories, medical facilities (e.g. radiology & nuclear medicine), and in some pieces of analytical equipment. Areas and equipment containing radiological sources are marked with a magenta trefoil on yellow background along with caution warning statements. Radiological exposures may come from direct contact with materials or indirect exposures via proximity to areas equipment containing or emitting ionizing radiation. Radiation cannot be seen, smelled, or otherwise sensed, so preventative protective measures are necessary. In addition to the general protective measures indicated for chemicals listed above  Observe the time, distance and shielding rule  minimize time around radiological materials, maximize distance between yourself and radiological materials, and use shielding equipment to block or minimize indirect exposures. Follow safe handling techniques and use of protective equipment if working with radiation sources. The Radiation Safety Office will help define these parameters. If you work around ionizing radiation and become pregnant, you may declare your pregnancy to your employer. A declared pregnant worker has a lower maximum occupational radiation exposure limit that decreases any potential risk to the fetus. If you would like to declare your pregnancy, you may notify your P.I. or the Radiation Safety Department. If you declare your pregnancy, please complete the Pregnancy Declaration Form (Appendix D), or go to http   radiationsafety.utk.edu declare-pregnancy  and submit the form to the Radiation Safety Office. For further information about pregnancy declaration, please read the Guidance Document from the State of Tennessee  http   radiationsafety.utdev4.wpengine.com wp-content uploads sites 20 2013 04 State_Pregnancy.pdf Recordkeeping EHS will maintain any monitoring records and chemical inventories for a minimum of 30 years. Any medical records will be maintained for at least 30 years. All health and monitoring records shall be treated as confidential. Training EHS provides general lab safety training (which includes hazard communication). The Biosafety and Radiation Safety Offices also provide hazard-specific training for students, staff and faculty. In addition, supervisors should provide on-the-job training and communicate any potential reproductive hazards to employees. Employees must have access to SDSs and other agent-specific information as required by regulations and or institutional policies procedures.

Effective Date  02 01 2016 Revision Date  08 24 2018 jump to appendices and forms   highlight  Purpose This guide serves to assist those planning off-campus work to identify safety and health concerns for individuals or groups representing the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. Scope and Applicability This document has been designed as a non-mandatory guide to assist individuals and groups who are traveling off campus and may encounter unexpected hazards. Fieldwork or offsite-work is an extraordinarily diverse area of consideration, however the same principles of safety one would use on campus apply. Anticipate and identify hazards Control hazards Elimination Substitution Engineering Controls Administrative Controls Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Prepare for and Mitigate the Consequences of Accidents If you are addressing your fieldwork with the above concepts, informing and training your personnel, providing appropriate resources (such as PPE) and managing practices in the field to adhere to a safety plan then you are on the right track. Although this is a guide, please note there are some sections of this document that may point to specific regulatory requirements. Where such a requirement may be present, such as excavations greater than four feet deep, they may be emphasized Abbreviations and Definitions Fieldwork  activities authorized by the University, conducted for the purpose of study, research, recreation, or teaching which are undertaken by faculty, staff, students, and authorized volunteers of the University at a location outside the geographical boundaries of the University campuses. Remote Areas  Areas of the world, including the United States, that are generally uninhabited and are many miles from potable water, electricity, communication, businesses, residential, medical, and other services. Roles and Responsibilities Supervisors are encouraged to  Use this document as a guide for individuals or groups who are traveling off-site from campus. Consult with EHS if there are any questions relative to this guide. Make suggestions for improving this guide. Encourage student and employee questions, dialogue, and engagement with safety concepts related to field work. Environmental Health and Safety shall  Maintain this guide in the safety manual online. Update the guide as necessary. Interpret the intent of the procedure where the meaning may not be clear. Assist departments and individuals to the extent feasible with hazard identification, training, and suggestions of appropriate controls. Add appendices as needed. Students and Employees shall  Follow directions as specified. Not engage in horseplay or other disruptive actions that could lead to an accident. Ask questions if uncertain of directions or safety protocol. Report hazards or near-misses that occur. Report any accidents, damaged equipment property or other losses to the supervisor. Use personal protective equipment when necessary and as instructed. Only undertake activities for which they are Properly trained Familiar or understand Physically capable of performing Guidance and Considerations General Considerations for Advanced Planning If you perform field work studies, you need to know and understand the potential hazards (common and unusual) presented by the area in which you will do field work. For example, there may be predatory animals (e.g., bears), venomous reptiles, amphibians, or toxic plants. You should ensure that you know what the precautions are for each potentially hazardous situation, and that you have received appropriate training to mitigate these situations. Accidents are always possible when working outdoors     cuts, sprains, falls, insect bites, sunburn, and dehydration are not uncommon. Consequently, it is vital that you follow the direction of your supervisor in the field at all times. Do not engage in horseplay. Prepare a Safety Plan Prepare a written Safety Plan of your trip. Provide a copy to each member of your team and leave a copy with a responsible party. Include the following  Your information and itinerary Locations, arrival and departure dates, names, addresses and phone numbers of all fieldwork participants. Activities General nature of activities being conducted Possible Risks Potentially hazardous plants, animals, terrain and weather conditions where you plan to work. Controls Elimination Substitution Engineering Controls Administrative Controls Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Emergency Plans Address the basics, safety and security, medical, fire, and weather. Then address specific plans for specific risks. Contact person Name and phone number of a person to contact in case of emergency- a spouse, parent or friend, as well as a campus contact. Local contacts Names of people at or near your fieldwork site who can reach you if necessary, as well as your check-in check-out arrangements Local Authorities It is advisable to contact local authorities to alert them to your presence before performing work. Consider this from several perspectives. If you require assistance, they will already have some awareness of your presence and activities and can render faster assistance. It is respectful and professional Unusual field activities may be seen by local residents as suspicious. Prevent causing alarm by respectful and professional contact with authorities. They may advise methods to prevent alarm. Medical Care and First Aid The following guidelines apply to all off-campus operations including field stations, academic field trips, field research, excursions, etc. that involve employees and students  A first aid kit should be maintained at all times during the operation or exercise. First aid kits are highly recommended for all off-campus operations. Departments must purchase and maintain first aid kits including any special equipment or medication that is needed. Kits and refills may be ordered from safety supply companies. EHS can assist with identifying vendors. At least one employee who is trained and certified in first aid and CPR should be present during operations. At permanent university field stations, written arrangements should be made in advance with local facilities for emergency medical treatment. If you are working from a field station you should find out what the arrangements are for emergency care. Job Related Injuries or Illnesses If a university employee suffers a job-related injury or illness, he she must notify his her supervisor within 24 hours. The employee   s department supervisor must complete the Report of Incident through UT Risk Management. If the injury is    serious    (amputation, permanent disfigurement, overnight hospital stay, fatality) notify your supervisor immediately. Furthermore, serious accidents must be reported to the UTK Safety Officer (EHS) immediately. International SOS can assist with emergency medical evacuation to the nearest hospital meeting international standards of care and repatriation of mortal remains. International Considerations If you are involved in international research, it is important to obtain your passport and visas well in advance of your travel. Ensure that you have appropriate health insurance coverage. Obtain any recommended vaccinations and make sure that you are aware of any health concerns and what food and water is safe to consume in the country and region of the country in which you will be working. The dangers may also be human, as the area in which you work may be an area in which there has been past present civil or political unrest. Check with the State Department so you know if there are any travel warnings or restrictions. Recordkeeping Appendix A (Offsite Safety Checklist) should be kept by the department until the trip is complete. The record (Appendix B  UTK Field Work Safety Planning Record) must be kept longer if there are any of the following. Injuries Damages or loss to equipment or property Anticipated legal or regulatory actions In these cases the length of retention shall be based on the nature of the event. In addition, departments may consider keeping completed copies of Appendix B as reference for future similar trips. References OSHA General Industry Standards 29 CFR 1910. See appendices.

From Pride of the Southland band members practicing for the fall to Facilities employees beautifying campus to scientists conducting fieldwork, many members of the campus community are susceptible to heat-related illnesses. These tips can help you avoid heat stress  Drink plenty of water before you begin work and drink often during the workday. Avoid drinking caffeine or alcohol before and during your time in the heat. Acclimate yourself to working in the heat. Gradually increase your workload and take more frequent breaks during the first week of work and after you   ve been away from work for a week or more. Gradual exposure to heat gives the body time to become accustomed to higher environmental temperatures. Know your limitations, including your age and physical condition. Discuss with your health care provider how medications may affect your tolerance to heat. Know the signs of heat stroke, which include headache, nausea, dizziness, weakness, heat cramps and heat rash. Environmental Health and Safety will be taking temperature and humidity readings at various locations on campus throughout the summer. This information will be shared with affected departments to assist supervisors and workers in managing heat-related illnesses. The US Occupational Safety and Health Administration has a heat stress safety app that helps you calculate the heat index of your worksite and displays the risk level for outdoor workers. The app works on both Android and iOS devices. More information is available on the OSHA website. For guidance on heat stress prevention or to learn more about it, visit the Environmental Health and Safety website, call 865-974-5084, or email safety@utk.edu. -- CONTACT  April Case (865-974-5084, acase3@utk.edu)","link":"https:\/\/ehs.utk.edu\/index.php\/2018\/06\/15\/tips-to-prevent-heat-stress-when-working-outdoors\/"},{"title":"CPR-AED Training Opportunities &#8211; July, 2018","content":"CPR-AED Training Opportunities     July, 2018 Environmental Health & Safety Invites faculty, staff & students to register for CPR AED and First Aid Training.

You want to know that it works, and that it will provide clean fresh water every time. Checking your eyewash regularly is critical to having Fresh Water for Sure Consider the following  Do you need an eyewash? Safety regulations require the following     Where the eyes or body of any person may be exposed to injurious corrosive materials, suitable facilities for quick drenching or flushing of the eyes and body shall be provided within the work area for immediate emergency use.    Where is your eyewash? Locate your nearest eyewash as well as a secondary one. Do you understand how to use it? Emergency eyewashes operate with simple controls, such as paddles, levers, or squeeze releases. They are designed for hands-free operation. Once you turn it on, it should stay on. Any protective caps should automatically open or release, and the flow of water should be clean, even, and tepid (not too hot or too cold). Is your eyewash maintained and tested? Ask your supervisor about the upkeep of your eyewash. Principle Investigators and Lab Managers should test or designate someone to test your eyewash station weekly.  highlight color= fountain   When performing a weekly eyewash flush, check the following  Access Ensure that the eyewash station is easily identifiable and unobstructed. Carts, chairs, glassware, and equipment can obstruct an eyewash station, slowing or preventing emergency response. If you need an eyewash station, you will not be able to see very well, and you could be highly distracted by pain, discomfort, or confusion. Operation Ensure that the eyewash station activates easily with one-handed control, the flow removes eyepiece covers, and water flows evenly and in a steady stream. Allow the eyewash station to run for 1-3 minutes to flush stagnant water from the line. If this is your first time flushing the station, you may have to run it longer to ensure that the water is clean. Report malfunctioning eyewash stations to Facilities Services at 865-946-7777. If your eyewash station does not have a drain, ensure you use a bucket to capture the water. Helpful hints Make sure you know where the water drains! Often a bucket or a tray has to be positioned under the unit   s drain to collect the water. Have a roll of paper towels on hand in case of water leakage. A large tray may be needed to collect the water under units that pull down from the wall to activate.   highlight  If you have questions please contact EHS at ehs_labsafety@utk.edu or 865-974-5084.

One of Prior   s priorities is to pinpoint ways the department can close communication gaps, be more efficient and broaden its service delivery across campus. The department   s responsibilities include inspection of all UT research labs, identification of requirements for maintaining a building   s safety systems, hazardous waste management, fire safety, industrial and general safety oversight, environmental compliance, training and technical assistance for the vast array of UT   s safety programs. The unit works with every academic and administrative unit on campus to ensure and promote the safety of students, employees, and visitors. Prior also serves as the safety officer for the UT Graduate School of Medicine, which has 41 labs. As construction continues around campus, Prior envisions the Department of Environmental Health and Safety will be critical in that process.    One of the things we   re trying to do is review drawings for new buildings or redesigns for what the buildings might need,    she said.    That way, we can anticipate the safety issues so they don   t get built into the buildings.    Prior brings more than 35 years of experience in environmental health and safety program development and management with national, international, government, research, and academic organizations. Prior came to UT from the College of William and Mary where she served as director of environmental health and safety. Previously, she worked with the Department of Energy   s Jefferson Lab in Newport News, Virginia, and as an environmental science consultant with the U.S. Army. She replaces Mark Smith who retired in the spring. Prior supervises 13 employees in the Department of Environmental Health and Safety.    They   re really a great team and are working hard,    she said.    I   m impressed with all they do given the limited resources they have and the limited tools of their trade.    Of East Tennessee she said,    I like the camaraderie here. There is a strength of community in Knoxville and at the university.    The Department of Environmental Health and Safety is housed under UT Public Safety. Public Safety also oversees the UT Police Department, the Office of Emergency Management and UT Clery Compliance.","link":"https:\/\/ehs.utk.edu\/index.php\/2018\/09\/25\/environmental-health-and-safety-welcomes-new-director\/"},{"title":"Case Leaves EHS After 11 Years of Service","content":"Case Leaves EHS After 11 Years of Service April Case, a longtime member of the Department of Environmental Health and Safety, has left UT for other opportunities to promote her professional career. During her time at UT, Case progressed from managing environmental programs to leading a team that also included industrial and worker safety programs. Most recently she served as interim director after the former director, Mark Smith, retired in April 2018.    Through her experiences and accomplishments, April covered a broad spectrum of technical environmental health and safety areas, which made her a valuable asset and resource for the team and the campus,    said new EHS director Sandra Prior.    It made her the perfect choice to be the interim director because she understood the needs of the different groups.    Case   s last day at the university was January 7, 2019.
