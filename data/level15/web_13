By effectively and efficiently supplying these services, CIS is able to support the primary mission of Facilities Services  to provide, maintain, and optimize the campus  physical resources and environments for all staff, faculty & students     which, ultimately, supports and promotes the University of Tennessee s VolVision, its long range Masterplan, and its goal of becoming a top research institution.

This unit encompasses four primary offices  the Office of Sustainability, Communications & PR, IT Support & Maintenance, and Employee Training & Development. The Office of Sustainability (OoS) aims to foster sustainable development and to promote environmental stewardship at the University by strategically bridging the gap between campus operations, teaching, research, and outreach  this includes, but is by no means limited to  infusing sustainability into the curriculum, developing and implementing efficient and economical operations across campus, while growing this office   s influence across campus in a manner that is both supportive and innovative to our campus environment, with a focus on infusion through ownership, as opposed to implementation via sweeping mandate. More specifically, the OoS is tasked with reducing annual Greenhouse Gas emissions to zero (carbon neutral) by the year 2061. Communications & Public Relations (CPR) is tasked with promoting employee morale, managing Facilities Services social media sites, creating and promoting departmental videos, planning department events, acting as the Public Information Office for campus and in the Facilities Services Emergency Task Force, managing the branding of all Facilities Services units and offices, maintaining the campus-wide Building Representative list, updating content on the campus Cone Zone site and departmental website, promoting the department through campus-events  and, when appropriate, fielding customer questions and concerns, as well as acting as the website editor on the TNAPPA board.

IT also manages SCUP improvements and device identification and registration for all network attached equipment installed in Facilities Services. The department currently has over 1,100 devices on the network, including computers, printers, mobile devices, building automation services and life safety systems (fire alarm, building access, etc.). IT also acts as a liaison between Facilities Services and OIT when projects or maintenance issues affect network infrastructure, server support, or campus provided IT services. The Training & Employee Development (TED) office provides Facilities Services employees with flexible opportunities for personal and professional growth through education, training, and workplace experience. TED also serves as a one-stop for many employees seeking answers for everyday work questions, situations or needs. Primary office activities include, but not limited to  orienting new employees for the shop or area in which they will work  promoting, facilitating, keeping records, and reporting on OSHA-required safety training  providing assistance to employees wishing to use the department   s computer lab for work-related reasons  managing the Respiratory Protection Program  collaborating to create job aids (print, digital, video) that relate to training programs  and, creating and maintaining employee identification badges.

The MS4 is governed by the State of Tennessee National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit. This permit is required by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation as mandated by the Environmental Protection Agency under the Clean Water Act of 1972. The primary goal of the MS4 is to improve and or maintain the quality of surface waters by reducing the amount of pollutants in storm water as a result of continued urbanization. Polluted runoff is commonly transported through MS4s, from which it is often discharged untreated into local water bodies. To prevent harmful pollutants from being washed or dumped into an MS4, operators must obtain a NPDES permit and develop a Stormwater Management Plan which consists of six components. The implementation and enforcement of these components,listed below, is collectively referred to as the Stormwater Management Plan.

To provide complete transparency to our customers we welcome you to explore all the links, documents, and pages outlined below. Departmental Practices Information Reorganization Initiated to right-size our workforce, to become more customer focused, to improve management oversight, improve work environments, and increase our proactive maintenance resulting in much more efficient building operations and less system downtime. Cost Savings Always looking to reduce costs while increasing service through reallocation of savings and implementing other cost-based efficiencies. Operations Maintenance is currently one of the smallest university expenditures on campus - falling into the bottom four primary expenditures with just a 7% share of the university   s overall budget spending. Service Standards We take pride in our Customer-focused service, always looking to increase service and improve customer satisfaction (94% approval, FY14). Skilled Workforce We maintain a comprehensive training program, allowing us to cross-train employees which gives them the tools to perform additional types of repairs & services while troubleshooting more quickly, resulting in a lower cost to the university. This also allows us to recruit better, more devoted hires to the University from the start. Purchasing Power Delegated purchasing amounts, contract leveraging, and strategic sourcing all allow us to get system-wide discounts, while still enabling us to utilize local vendors, boosting the entire region s economy. Deferred Maintenance We continually prioritize and explore challenges opportunities to provide the best services at the lowest possible cost. Energy Conservation We maintain nationally award winning programs, LEED certified buildings, Zero Waste recycling initiatives, and consistently avoid increased utilities costs. Technology Standards We have implemented IWMS (Archibus), which is a globally recognized enterprise computer system with more than 8 million users world-wide (saving their organizations more than $100 billion annually). Best Business Practices We employ industry best practices to create sustainable facility and building management across a broad real estate portfolio, providing ever increasing customer satisfaction in all types of spaces. Types of facilities we service include  technical research buildings, classrooms, offices, residences, agricultural and animal quarter areas, arena stadium spaces, mechanical areas, library study spaces, athletic facilities, exhibition areas, daycare builidngs, healthcare and medical areas, secure hazardous sites, warehouseing space, and more.

Overall reorganizational concepts include supporting the University of Tennessee Academic Research Vision and Mission, supporting the Chancellor   s goal to become a Top 25 Research Institution, converting maintenance crews from reactive groups to dynamic proactive teams, and focusing on the department   s core tasks  Maintenance and Project Management. Much of this has been accomplished through the reconfiguration of Design and Construction, and through the re-envisioned and service-expanded Administrative Support, Training, IT Support, Utilities, Zone Maintenance and Communications areas, all of which ensure that Facilities Services is able to meet the needs of the campus community like never before. Contact  Dave Irvin, Associate Vice Chancellor Phone  (865) 974-2178 Email  irvin@utk.edu Facilities Services Reorganization Highlights     Creation of STAR and RRT work teams to directly support the University s Academic and Research Visions.     Creation of a Communications & Public Relations team to highlight services available to the campus community     Social media sites increase awareness of what the department does, while notifying customers of important outages, campus projects and events. Facilities Services can be found on the following social media platforms Twitter, Facebook, YouTube,Pinterest and Google+.    Facilities Fundamentals Workshop - programs for campus, along with a DIY Video series to promote education and continued learning, in turn strengthening the core missing of the university.    Employee Recognition Programs to showcase employees and to create competition to increase customer satisfaction and service.    Projects Catalogs - which detail completed and ongoing projects to help keep the campus community aware of department activities.    Cone Zone updates completed on a monthly basis to ensure ADA students, as well as the rest of campus, can quickly find detours and possible time delays in getting around campus.    Surveys (Customer Satisfaction and Employee Satisfaction), bench-marking and data collection are completed to help expose any department inefficiencies and areas that could improve, as the department is always seeking any possible advancements.     Creation of an Employee Training & Development team to focus departmental skill improvement in employees at all levels     providing a targeted, Facilities-based Orientation for all new employees.    interviewing and hiring training for managers that reduces turn-over throughout the department while helping supervisors to choose more highly skilled employees from the start.    Specialized Facilities Training Programs      Facilities University (cross-training courses)     CCP (Custodial Certification Program)     Career Ladders Paths     Skillsoft (required, PPE & OSHA training)     ESL (English as a Second Language)    Training staff also oversee the department computer lab. More information about all of these areas can be found in the Employee Training & Development Annual Report.     Employee uniform branding and ID badges have added Facilities Services employees to the campus community as fully integrated members (Go Vols!). Facilities Services workers are no longer just outside staffers who swoop in to take care of a problem or an issue and then disappear, but they have become a true part of the University family -- highly visible, and completely accessible to all customers wherever they turn on campus.     The Office of Sustainability and UT Recycling programs have been rebranded through Make Orange Green to showcase both award winning services. The two offices generate substantial cost avoidance including Energy Cost Reductions ($570,752 compared to FY14), the Annual POWER Challenge (saved $49,000 in energy and water reductions in student dormitories, FY15), Living Learning Community, LEED buildings, Zero Waste Programs, and landfill avoidance. More information about Sustainability s cost avoidance can be found in the office s Annual Report.     Zone Maintenance has completely shifted its emphasis from a reactive group to proactive group, with the implementation of inspection teams and the STAR Team.     Building Services has re-envisioned customer service by reversing its outsourcing of custodial work, and taking back 5 million square feet of cleaning in-house, phasing out its contractor, and adding 140 new positions.     Increased efficiency with the replacement of its legacy CMMS with a globally recognized enterprise IWMS (Archibus) system, adding mobile devices into the hands of field workers for faster response and turn-around times.     Integrated the Design and Construction teams     Oversight of Facilities Planning projects    Targeted and focused renovation teams    More intensive campus planning     Landscape Master Plan     Utilities Master Plan     Campus Design Color Initiative     The department has really shifted its entire workforce to focused-supervision and more efficient teams. This has lead to many internal promotions and higher wages over the past four years. Contact  Dave Irvin, Associate Vice Chancellor Phone  (865) 974-2178 Email  irvin@utk.edu Facilities Operations Reorganization Building Services  Facilities Services began the transition to in-house custodial services in its Building Services office in April 2012, with an acquisition of 250,000 square feet in the Conference Center, where the Total Cleaning program was tested as a part of the Facilities Services reorganization. Total Cleaning has resulted in the complete transfer of university custodial services, including the Agricultural Campus, as of June 1, 2014. Rapid Response Team (RRT)  During reorganization, an important goal was transitioning from a reactive group to proactive team. The Rapid Response Team (RRT) has been developed as a specialized unit that handles overall facilities inspection, quality control, special projects and customer service initiatives. RRT receives work requests from all areas of the UT campus, and has a wide variety of skills in the areas of electrical, plumbing, carpentry and heavy equipment. Landscape Services  As an early part of the Facilities Services reorganization, Landscape Services brought mowing and leaf removal services in-house in 2009, allowing the university to maintain campus grounds at a savings over previously contracted work every year since, with an average savings of approximately $325,000. No personnel were terminated in this transition, and new personnel have been hired and trained through the savings generated. Contact  Bob Caudill, Facilities Operations Director Phone  (865) 974-3486 Email  rcaudill@utk.edu Zone Maintenance Reorganization A key component of the Facilities Services reorganization, the modified    Zone Concept    divides the campus into 15 customer-oriented zones, each overseen by a respective Zone Maintenance unit, which allows for a proactive approach to customer service and repair. Zone Maintenance has personnel assigned to almost every building on the campus, and provides general maintenance services within educational and general purpose buildings on both the Main and Agricultural campuses. These services encompass almost all general, day-to-day maintenance and repair needs. In keeping with the University of Tennessee   s goal of becoming a Top 25 Research Institution, Facilities Services also created the STAR Team (Special Team to Assist Research) as an office of Zone Maintenance. The STAR Team assists new researchers in getting their research programs running in a timely fashion once they arrive on campus. The team also works with existing researchers during changes in programming requirements and with day-to-day maintenance issues that may arise. Contact  Terry Ledford, Zone Maintenance Director Phone  (865) 406-1736 Email  tledfor1@utk.edu Communication & Info Services Reorganization Amidst the department   s other numerous changes, the Communication   s & Information Services unit has also grown and experienced many improvements and accomplishments since the reorganization. Communications & Public Relations  One of the purposeful changes in this unit includes the introduction of the Communications & Public Relations office, which assists with all departmental communication, inter-departmental communication, and general public relations work for the department. This office also maintains all of the department   s Web site and social media content. IT Support & Maintenance  Although staffed by only two full-time employees, the IT Support & Maintenance office continues to play a vital role in the evolution of Facilities Services as a whole. Like most other offices within the department, IT Support & Maintenance has also undergone a great deal of change during the reorganization, while still managing to tackle the needs of a large and dynamic department. In 2013 an IT Technologist II position was added to the unit to help curb the growing demand for IT support and help introduce newer technologies to the workforce. In particular, IT Support & Maintenance is overseeing the integration of an Integrated Workplace Management System (IWMS) to replace the current legacy work order management system, and to improve self-assessment and benchmarking capabilities of the department. Employee Training & Development  At the outset of the Facilities Services Department reorganization efforts in 2012, the need for an expanded training team quickly became evident. By re-allocating a portion of its annual budget and pursuing a goal of funding training activities to 5% of the department   s overall budget, the Facilities Services Department created an Employee Training and Development office in March 2013. Training staff can now boast significant milestones in the department   s employee development  including significant increases in the number of training hours employees have participated in so far, career    ladder path    programs to foster advancement, ERC training for supervisors, and cross-training skill-sharing programs, which have facilitated the reassignment of personnel during Facilities Services reorganization efforts, reducing the number of employees hired to fill new positions, and increasing overall competency. Contact  Kevin Garland, Communications & Information Services Director Phone  (865) 974-4009 Email  garlandk@utk.edu Utilities Services Reorganization Another key component of the Facilities Services reorganization involved consolidating Plumbing & Heating Services, Electrical Services, A C Services and the Steam Plant into one managed unit under the Director of Utilities Services. The pooling of these fundamental services improves coordination, while ensuring adequate oversight. Contact  Roy Warwick, Utilities Services Director Phone  (865) 974-7768 Email  rwarwick@utk.edu Design Reorganization Design Services Throughout the reorganization, Facilities Services changed its approach to Design Services, creating a unique aesthetic that speaks to the heritage and identity of the University of Tennessee, while also reassigning personnel and responsibilities to more efficiently and effectively serve our campus community. By taking this new approach to unit alignment, Landscape Design, Project Management, Codes Enforcement, and Space & Archives Inventory, Design Services has vastly improved these vital service areas. This accomplished the creation and upkeep of a digital drawing and specification archive from legacy (paper) records  new positions added for full-time Interior Design, Landscape Design, Electrical Engineering and Civil Engineering project managers and coordinators  the implementation of codes enforcement Redi-check procedures for drawings submitted by designers  increased communication with Fire Marshals at the local and state levels, and the transference of estimating responsibilities to Construction, streamlining the design process, while improving overall unit communication. Landscape Design  Some new policies and procedures ushered in by the new vision and core principles for campus Landscaping and Design include improved project programming that involves Facilities Services, university administration, and design consultants collaborating to establish project scope and budget. The newly formed Campus Planning and Design Committee (CP+DC) now oversees all campus projects in an effort to bring unity to campus design and aesthetic standards. Other duties overseen by Landscape Design include developing and maintaining the Campus Landscape Vision and Site Standards document, preparing site construction documents and specifications, playing a vital role in site design review and construction administration for projects executed by the Facilities Planning Department, and administering the EPA National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Phase II Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) Permit. Contact  Andy Powers, Design Services Director Phone  (865) 599-3254 Email  appowers@utk.edu Construction Reorganization The creation of the Construction Services unit during the Facilities Services reorganization has decreased time taken to complete projects, and improved construction efficiency. Construction Services assists the campus with construction and renovation activities, and is available to assist with projects performed by the Office of Facilities Planning to help control costs, achieve quality, and monitor the interests of the campus community. Construction Services also develops specifications for material and contracts, and now assists with estimating and design on projects, consulting with architects, engineers, and clients concerning the ongoing development of campus projects. Other reorganization improvements include the formation of a small cross-disciplinary construction team, which now provides quick and effective in-house construction solutions, increased responsiveness, improved communication, and the elimination of unnecessary expenditure.

Both systems which use steam from the central steam plant, and those with separate or stand-alone systems. Approximately 100 different heating systems are maintained on campus in addition to the central steam system equipment. Heating systems located in various buildings on the campus include, electric, gas fired boilers and furnaces, and hydronic hot water heating systems. Changeover from Air Conditioning to Heat Facilities Services personnel change over building on 2 pipe systems from air conditioning to heating each fall. Due to the nature of the equipment installed throughout the campus, buildings must be changed over separately. Facilities Services performs the changeover on the basis of priorities established 1) to maintain required temperatures to protect equipment and research in progress, and 2) to serve the greatest number of individuals and activities. Heating changeover may not begin until outside low temperatures have dropped below at least 50 degrees F for a minimum of three consecutive days. Consideration is also given to temperature projections. The wide swings in temperature during the fall have made this policy necessary. Special problems or hardships with the policy should be discussed with the Vice Chancellor of Facilities Services.

More than 153 buildings, containing more than 8,000,000 square feet of space, are served by the Steam Plant. Steam is used for heating and domestic hot water in these facilities, as well as to operate sterilizers, autoclaves, etc. Eleven miles of underground steam pipe and return lines crisscross the main and agricultural campuses. See the Steam Plant Conversion page for more information about the  plant   s conversion from coal to natural gas which was completed in 2016. UT Steam Plant Boilers  The #1 boiler is a converted coal fired boiler, which can produce 70,000 pound of steam per hour with either natural gas or #2 diesel. Boilers #2, #3, and #5 can produce 80,000 of steam per hour with either natural gas or #2 diesel. The natural gas fired turbine generator is rated at 5MW with a heat recovery boiler. The exhaust from the turbine can produce 23,000 pounds of steam per hour, and with the use of an auxiliary duct burner that can bring up the output to 110,000 pounds of steam per hour. Use of Natural Gas  The Steam Plant is supplied natural gas from two separate sources. A new 8    gas line that comes in at 450 psi and is reduced 225 psi for use in the gas turbine. It also goes through another set of pressure regulators that reduce the pressure to 40 psi to be used in the boilers. The old 6    gas line is still in service and provides natural gas at 185 psi. In the event of the loss of the 450-psi gas line the plant still maintains two 300 HP gas compressors that boost the gas pressure up to 225 psi, which are needed for the Solar gas turbine generator. Emergency Generator  The Steam Plant has a 2937 horsepower emergency generator that can produce 2 megawatts of electrical power in the event of electrical outages. The Steam Plant also has seven fuel oil storage tanks to supply fuel oil to the boilers in case of curtailment of our natural gas supply. Water Treatment & Testing Equipment  Water must be treated before being introduced into the boilers to prevent build-up of scale corrosion. Water is tested and treated continuously, and the process allows for the identification of problems with the steam distribution system.

This is accomplished by assisting new researchers by renovating their lab space, helping them get acclimated to campus, and installing their lab equipment to ensure they can hit the ground running when they get to campus. The STAR Team also assists existing researchers with changes in programming requirements and assisting existing researchers with day-to-day problems that may arise, such as issues with the lab   s HVAC, electrical and plumbing to ensure there are no interruptions to the research. This subunit took over the responsibility for the TVA Energy Road Map, which includes energy auditing of buildings and working with College of Engineering students on senior design projects that benefit campus by conserving energy. The STAR Team also identifies and implements energy saving projects to be used for the green fee revolving loan fund as part of the roadmap. The STAR Team is leading the way to predictive maintenance techniques with vibration analysis, shaft alignment, and thermal analysis. Zone Maintenance acquired the equipment to do this type of work and is now training Zone Maintenance personnel to use it to balance all the equipment on campus to maximize efficiency.

This includes lighting and electrical systems, heating, ventilating and air conditioning systems, plumbing systems, laboratory systems, and structural and building envelope systems including roofing, walls and windows. Campus is organized into nine zones by type of customer and building. Lighting systems With 250-plus buildings there are thousands of lighting fixtures with hundreds of different style fixtures and lamps. This includes incandescent lighting, which has mostly been phased out and replaced with compact fluorescent and LED. Metal halide and high pressure sodium fixtures are in the process of being replaced with or retrofitted to LED. While some of these are retrofitted en masse when funding is available, these retrofits are also done as a normal course of maintenance when the cost to repair approaches the cost to retrofit or replace. Electrical systems Zone Maintenance personnel have recently received arc flash training, clothing, and tools and are able to repair more and more systems that we used to rely on Utility Shops to repair. These enhanced capabilities are key to being able to respond to customer   s needs on a more timely basis. Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning Systems Heating systems  With the broad range of ages of buildings we have a veritable museum of HVAC systems. Most of the heating is powered via steam from the Steam Plant with heat exchange systems ranging from convection radiators to variable air volume reheat systems via direct steam or heating water systems via steam to water heat exchangers. We also have gas, electric, and radiant space heaters, and baseboard heat via electric or heating water. Air conditioning systems range from DX window air conditioners, to DX to air distribution systems, to chilled water systems with variable speed variable air volume air handlers and variable speed pumping systems. Piping systems range from two-pipe to four-pipe, plus we still have a three-pipe system in place. Air distribution is via constant and variable volume air handling systems, fan coils, and PTACS. Air handlers in laboratory spaces are designed for 100% outside air for dilution. In several laboratory buildings we also provide a process cooling water loop where the recirculated water is cooled to about 60F to eliminate the waste from once through water from the domestic system. Ventilation systems range from residential style restroom exhaust fans through variable volume laboratory fume hood systems with variable speed fans and energy recovery. Plumbing systems As with other systems the plumbing systems cover a broad expanse of time. Plumbing fixtures span from sink and dual spout and handle faucets to automatic sensors and mixing valves to control water temperature. Hot water is provided via electric, gas, or steam driven heaters. In most buildings the hot water is looped to recirculate in order to provide hot water almost instantaneously. Sanitary drainage systems include older cast iron, to PVC, to glass and acid resistant materials for laboratories. Drainage from laboratories flows through acid neutralization prior to discharge to the local utility. Laboratory Buildings Zone Maintenance also has responsibility for laboratory water systems including deionized and reverse osmosis systems. Compressed air systems range from small reciprocating compressors for HVAC controls to larger oil-free screw compressors with air dryers delivering air at minus 40 dewpoint. Laboratory buildings have natural gas distribution to fume hoods and bench tops and a nitrogen generating system in Science Engineering. Vacuum systems for laboratories are provided via reciprocating pump systems up to multi-pump screw or rotary pumps. Zone Maintenance has responsibility for the building envelope including walls, windows, doors, and roofs. These are systems that require continuing attention in order to maintain proper indoor conditions for building occupants and to maintain the structural integrity of the systems. Elevators There are over 200 elevators on Campus ranging from two-stop wheelchair lifts to high-rise multi-floor units. Elevator types range from hydraulic, to traction, to machine room less elevators. Elevator maintenance is handled via contract with a local office of a major elevator manufacturer. The contract requires 24 7 365 response within one-hour. Other Responsibilities Although food preparation is provided by contract with an outside company, Zone Maintenance personnel provide maintenance and repair for all of the food service equipment. This includes all of the stoves, ovens, dishwashers, and conveyor systems in all dining establishments. Zone Maintenance also provides system maintenance for all Athletics facilities and most of the Housing units. Emergency Management A new emphasis has been on Zone Maintenance   s role in campus emergency management. Zone Maintenance personnel take an active daily role in emergency management, serving as emergency planning coordinators. In this role, the Maintenance Specialists take the lead in emergency response on a building-by-building basis, working with emergency responders to help assure the safety of the building occupants.

Invoices written in pencil will not be accepted by the university. Preparing Invoices for Approval and Payment  1. Upon receipt of the invoice, the date received (month, day, year) should be written or stamped on the invoice. 2. Confirm receipt of all items purchased. If there was a purchase order, the number must appear on the invoice. If not preprinted on the invoice, the department may write the purchase order number on the invoice. 3. Confirm calculation of the invoice is correct. If not, contact the vendor for a revised invoice. If verbal authorization to correct revise the invoice is received, write the name of person from the vendor approving the correction on the invoice. 4. UT is tax exempt. Therefore, sales tax should be deducted from the invoice. A Tennessee sales tax exemption form can be found on the Treasurer s Office web site. 5.

Average price per person, including beverages and tips. For large groups the estimated number may be used for this calculation if the actual number is not known.**When alcoholic beverages are part of entertainment events (events include any meal reimbursement other than the standard per diem claim), the cost, including tax, of alcoholic beverages must always be separately identifiable on the receipts and supporting documentation and charged to an appropriate restricted account. Costs of alcoholic beverages are not permitted on federally sponsored grants and contracts. 5. Total amount due with all expenses itemized, including alcohol if applicable. 4.

The Business Service Office maintains related fiscal records for the Facilities Service Department while providing information, service and support to the University community. Accounts receivable represent debts owed to Facilities Services for maintenance, repairs, rentals and services provided to auxiliaries, departments, groups or individuals surrounding the University of Tennessee   s Knoxville Campus. These debts are considered short term and are normally expected to be paid to the university within 30 days after the Service Requests are completed. BILLING  Billings for Facilities Services can be broken down into three categories  Auxiliary Charges, Departmental Charges and Project Charges Auxiliary charges are the maintenance and repairs for auxiliary entities outside of the University   s standard academic infrastructure  the Athletic Department, College of Veterinary Medicine, ETREC, University Housing, fraternities and sororities are just a few auxiliaries that are provided maintenance by the Facilities Services team. Facilities Services provides shop services to systems (i.e., mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems), the exterior envelope of the building, and all attached components within the building (i.e., flooring, carpeting). These repairs are necessary to keep the building operating efficiently and safely. Certain items such as painting, carpet and tile replacement, and window air conditioner replacement are performed on established cycles. All expenses related to this work are billed (or invoiced) to the maintenance and operating Cost Centers or entity that has been established for each auxiliary.

Projects at the University of Tennessee are generally divided into two main categories  Capital Projects and Non-Capital Projects. Capital Projects include new construction, renovations, alterations or enhancements to buildings over $100,000. Financing may come from within a school department and or central funding, but may come from other sources such as gifts to the university or fund-raising events. Non-Capital Projects include renovations, alterations or enhancements to buildings LESS THAN $100,000. Financing for Non-Capital Projects generally comes from within a school or department. Funding must be approved prior to the start of the construction process. Estimate requests can be entered at the Facilities Services web-site using this  link to PP28. PAYMENTS  Payment Type     Internal Transfers Facilities Services Work Requests for department and certain auxiliary charges are billed weekly from Archibus using internal transfers into IRIS. Campus financial officers will receive email notifications from Archibus, directing them to logon to Archibus (archibus.tennessee.edu) and approve or reject any chargeable service requests that Facilities Services receives before work is started. By empowering campus departments to review chargeable service requests before any work begins, we hope to facilitate better fiscal awareness and to prevent any unexpected charges that may impact campus budgets.

For frequently asked questions about building representatives, please see our Building Rep Fact Sheet. Senior faculty or administrators are acceptable as building representatives. In buildings whose function is wholly or predominantly academic, the building representative is appointed by the dean whose college is assigned the majority of space within the facility, with the concurrence of other deans whose units have space assigned within the facility. Building representatives are appointed in the fall, and a general updated list of Building Representatives is available here. See our Space Scheduling Policy for information on reserving buildings and classrooms. Expect routine updates and modifications to this Web site as they are received and processed by Facilities Services. Duties In buildings where space is assigned to several units, building representatives are encouraged to identify a small advisory group to assist in problem identification resolution and information dissemination. The building representative notifies building occupants about emergency situations, advises the Associate Vice Chancellor for Facilities Services on general maintenance needs, and ensures that the university   s facilities database correctly reflects space assignments. Other duties of building representatives include authorizing student groups to sell or distribute goods or services on university grounds, and approving these activities through the Dean of Students    Office. It is important that no sale, distribution, or solicitation be conducted on university grounds without the express authorization of the Chief Business Officer. Communication A list of building representatives and their home and or cell telephone numbers are included in the university   s emergency plan. However, building representative home telephone numbers will not be distributed under anything but emergency situations. Usually, a senior support employee will serve as a secondary contact, should the building representative be unavailable. Building representatives are informed by the Facilities Services Department of  Scheduled disruptions of building services (e.g., power, elevator service, steam, or water). Emergency situations that may affect or have affected building services. Scheduled disruptive maintenance, such as painting or carpet replacement. Likewise, building representatives are asked to submit a work order and    Special Request    (PP-28 Form) to Facilities Services to bring special maintenance and custodial needs to the attention of facilities personnel. Such items include  Replacing worn-out chalkboards whiteboards. Repairing or replacing broken seating in classrooms. Damages in the walls, ceiling, or floor. Any problem related to elevator service. Burned out light bulbs or tubes. Pest infestations. Interior exterior damage. Electrical service interruption. Heating air conditioning interruption. In addition, the office of the Facilities Services Associate Vice Chancellor communicates with Building Representatives regarding  Approved renovations or extraordinary maintenance work. Changes in assignment of space. The status of capital maintenance or capital outlay projects for which state funding has been requested. Building representatives also communicate recommendations to the appropriate dean or director regarding the building as a whole, as well as its common spaces. The dean or director contacted then considers these recommendations against college or division priorities, and then passes their recommendation on to the appropriate Vice Chancellor for final consideration. Examples of such recommendations are  Policies for building general access or use. Scheduling renovations. Changes or updates to safety policies and procedures.

The UT Steam Plant Conversion Project began in 2014 with the first phase consisting of the removal of coal boiler #3 and installation of new natural gas boiler #3. Included in this work was the replacement of major electrical equipment within the plant such as the motor control centers which provide power to all plant equipment. This new equipment is arc flash resistant, thereby greatly enhancing the operational integrity and safety of the system. Phase 2 of the project consisted of the decommissioning and removal of coal boiler #2 and installation of new natural gas boiler #2. This work began in March of 2015 and was completed in November of the same year. Also included in this phase was the addition of a second high voltage feed to the plant providing increased electrical redundancy to keep the plant operating in the event of a campus electrical outage. During both of these phases additional fuel oil storage was added to provide for an alternate fuel in the event of a natural gas curtailment such as we experienced during extreme cold weather periods. Running concurrently with the first two phases of this work was the installation of a new high pressure natural gas main to the plant. This line was constructed from Topside road, several miles down Alcoa Highway, to the Fulton Bottoms Rugby Field area. From there it extends to the Steam Plant. The addition of this line was necessary not only to meet the increased demand for gas due to the installation of additional boilers, but the additional higher pressure will allow us to operate the existing 4.5 megawatt gas turbine generator without running the 300 horsepower electrically powered gas compressors currently needed for operation with lower gas pressures. This work was completed in time for the 2015-2016 heating season. Phase 3 of the project consists of the demolition and removal of the 300    smoke stack, electrostatic precipitator, remaining coal handling equipment, repaving demolition areas, replacing the roof and the replacement of windows within the plant itself. The smoke stack, electrostatic precipitator and remaining coal handling equipment have been demolished. Crews continue to work on the final Phase 3 items including paving, roof and window replacement.

The area around the statue will feature new pavers. Contractors will protect the sculpture throughout the course of the project, and the torch will be extinguished during construction for safety reasons. The torch will be relit before fall semester classes begin. A major improvement in Circle Park will be the addition of XtraGrass, a new type of landscaping that blends and reinforces natural grass with artificial turf, offering the look and feel of natural grass with increased resistance to wear. Circle Park will be completely closed off as crews work to install the sod, pathway lighting, and the irrigation system. A new walkaway and ramp will align to the entrance of McClung Museum of Natural History and Culture and nearby parking. Circle Park Drive will remain open to traffic during the project.

ADA access to the Science and Engineering Research Facility, and Perkins and Ferris Halls will be improved and integrated into the landscape. Wi-Fi connectivity will be increased through the area as well. The quad is meant to put an emphasis on the collaboration of the different College of Engineering disciplines by creating different areas where students can interact with each other. This area gives the college a gathering space that is central for events and other activities. A staircase from the quad will tie into the improved Estabrook streetscape that features new seating plazas, sidewalks, curbs, lighting, benches and trees, as well as increased Wi-Fi access. The chain-link fence along the street and some overhead utilities will be removed, and outdated lights will be replaced. These streetscape improvements will stretch from the Tickle Engineering Building Bridge to Cumberland Avenue. All on-street parking will be closed along Estabrook during the project and will reopen by the fall semester. The project along Estabrook is meant to give the area more of a park-like setting. Invasive plants will also be removed to open up the area around an existing small amphitheater.

We all live in a hyper-connected, highly inter-dependent world, where knowledge is the most important currency. Increasing educational attainment by a single grade level boosts lifetime income by 10-20 percent for girls, and 5-15 percent for boys. A global increase in attainment by just four grade levels could increase global economic demand by 50 percent or more. A better educated world is also a healthier world, a better steward of our planet  and, with low educational attainment among the strongest predictors of violence, a safer world. In a better-educated world, everyone benefits. Facilities Services strives to advance that educated world by maintaining and optimizing the physical resources and environments of this campus. Our number one priority is to create and maintain a clean, safe environment for students to study, faculty to teach, and staff to work. Our buildings protect us from the elements and give us a congregation point for academic, social, and economic advancement. Our campus is also home to many of the region s oldest buildings, as well as its newest and most modernized. Maintaining this mix of historic and modern buildings contributes tremendously, if not defines, the character of our campus. They also convey an image of a solid, lasting institution appealing to both students, parents, faculty, and staff. Our iconic historic buildings are often what alumni think of as they remember the campus. Along with beautiful, manicured landscapes and research-minded functionality, a properly maintained campus allow us to recruit the brightest, most talented students and faculty, while also increasing property values within the region. Newly constructed facilities meet the growing demands of research and education while stimulating local jobs and economies throughout their investment, and they also utilize the most sophisticated building systems to optimize space, energy use, and security.

Energy & Utilities Savings UT Knoxville has more than $30M in avoided utilities costs since 2002 and has been under budget in utilities by over $5M each of the last five years. The UT Facilities Services Energy Task Force identifies and reviews projects. In addition, this group analyzes system problems on campus and develops solutions. Facilities Services accomplishes many utilities savings projects each year by replacing less efficient components with more efficient components during normal maintenance activities. The Revolving Fund has allowed UT Knoxville to implement several small scale projects with quick savings. There is currently about $240,000 in identified projects with anticipated savings of $140,000 per year. Campus building management systems use the programming capabilities to schedule systems off when not needed, and to reset temperatures to maximize energy savings.

In order to achieve these things, we have a Green Cleaning Program. The program began at the university in 2006 when we became the first university in the nation to be Green Seal Cleaning Certified. The program and the practices have only grown since their inception. Because of our commitment to green cleaning, the university has been able to create a safer environment, increase recycling and zero-waste practices, and create a more sustainable method for keeping our campus clean, safe, and accessible     all the while, reducing our impact on the environment.

The University has decided to reverse its outsourcing of custodial work, and take 5 million square feet of cleaning back in-house, phasing out its current contractor, and adding 140 new positions.    T    Cleaning stands for    Total Cleaning    and it is through this comprehensive plan that the University will see an overall improvement in custodial services as outsourced buildings are moved back in-house.    T    Cleaning allows in-house custodial staff to deliver professional custodial services to building occupants. All buildings that UT employees clean are equipped with the proper supplies and tools to provide    Total    services to those buildings. This includes hard-floor care, shampooing, recycling, lavatory scrubbing, and detailed office cleaning. All public areas in these buildings are on a daily cleaning schedule while private areas (such as offices) are scheduled weekly. This enables    T    Cleaning to provide a higher level of service to our customers. Reception, public areas, and common areas receive nightly service, while private offices get detail vacuum, polished desks, trash removal and recycling on the appropriately scheduled night. If trash collection in a private office is needed more often, then the occupant only needs to place his her can(s) in the hall and they will be serviced that night. Occupants now know what services are provided and when     the key is communication. Facilities Services began transitioning custodial staff in April, 2012 with a switch-over of 250,000 square feet in the Conference Center Building. July 1st will see the additional change-over of HPER, Police Headquarters, Dabney-Buehler, Andy Holt Tower, Communications, and Student Services. Eleven new employees were added for this all-at-once transition, and the    T    Cleaning team has learned that changing-over more than one or two buildings at a time (training 11 people and opening 6 buildings) is a bit too much. So, to better facilitate future transitions, Facilities Services will only switch one or two buildings every 2 weeks. Twenty-seven additional buildings are included in the next stage, which will begin on July 31, 2012. We stand behind our    Total    Cleaning and look to provide a World Class service that any Top 25 Research Institution should expect. The University of Tennessee family is a close knit organization, and we know that everyone wishes to put their best foot forward in order to achieve our Top 25 goals, so if you have any questions or concerns, please call Gordon Nelson, Building Services General Superintendent, at (865) 974-2054. Questions & Answers Q  Are all doors supposed to be locked at night? A. Outside doors are either locked by the custodian or remotely locked by Central Alarm. Classrooms are locked by the custodian unless there   s nothing in the classroom besides chairs and a blackboard or white board. Offices should be locked by the occupant upon leaving and on nights the offices are cleaned they will be relocked by the custodian. Q  Are classrooms cleaned every night? A. Like other common areas (lobbies, hallways, restrooms, stairwells, elevators), classrooms are cleaned every night. In addition, the offices of Deans and Department Heads are considered to be common areas due to the high volume of traffic they receive. We are not always able to identify these individuals, so if this has not happened, please contact us. Q  Who should we call if there has been a roof leak and the carpet is wet? A. All Building Services requests can go through 974-5107 Monday through Friday from 8 am to 5 pm. Outside of these hours and days all requests for any type of service from Facilities Services can be obtained by calling 946-7777. This is a 24 7 any day of the year telephone line answered by a Facilities employee. Q  Why is my office garbage not removed every night? A. We are on the custodial schedule to allow custodians to do a professional cleaning job rather than trash detail. We have daily priorities, such as restroom cleaning for public health and sanitation. Only    wet    garbage needs to removed daily. Should you have    wet    garbage, we ask that you dispose of it in a community garbage can for daily removal. We are working within the same budget and improving our services. In order to do this, we have reallocated our time to cleaning public areas, such as restrooms, on a daily basis rather than emptying every trash can. This also allows us to save over $300,000 in trash liners. We ask that you join us in sustainability efforts. Q. On the night my office is scheduled to be cleaned, what can I expect? A. Once we have a fully-staffed unit, dusting, cleaning of desks that are cleared of daily work and clutter, dusting blinds, floor care, and cleaning of public areas, including restrooms, to enhance the curb appeal of the University. Q. What do I do if I run out of toilet paper? A. Double check to make sure no paper is in both compartments of the toilet paper dispenser and check less frequently utilized stalls. Otherwise, call Building Services 974-5107 or Gordon Nelson 974-2054 for supply needs.  raw  a link text-decoration none  a active text-decoration none  a visited text-decoration none   If you would like to have someone talk to you about Total Cleaning or need information on your scheduled night for cleaning, contact Gordon Nelson by email at gnelson5@utk.edu or by phone at (865) 974-2054.

The recipients of the 20th annual presentation of the award are Joel Rummage from Landscape Services and Rick Cannon from Electrical Services. Two awards are given every year, one from the skilled craft areas and one from the clerical, services and support areas, and each recipient must have at least 10 years of service with the university. This year Joel and Rick were chosen from 30 nominees. The awards ceremony was held October 29.    The awards celebrate excellence in our department,    said Associate Vice Chancellor Dave Irvin.    What I really love about these are that the winners aren   t chosen by me, they   re not chosen by the directors, they are chosen by a panel of their peers.    Joel has been with UT for 12 years and is a Supervisor with Landscape Services in Facilities Operations. He was nominated for his enthusiasm and dedication to the university while taking on more demanding landscape improvements with no additional staff to his crew. Joel serves as a mentor to new landscape personnel and has developed strong relationships with faculty, staff, and students in his districts of campus, and he is always first to volunteer for a challenge. He acts as the Landscape Services team lead in the effort for every football game to promote a cleaner tailgate experience and strengthen the recycling effort throughout campus. During the last three years Joel has given up several annual leave days to meet with state and local government representatives regarding the state-wide facilities management outsourcing as well as many other university initiatives. Joel   s dedication and pride is apparent to his supervisors and crew every day. Rick has been with the university for 17 years and is a Line Installer Foreman with Electrical Services in Utilities. One of the reasons Rick was nominated is for his hardworking and conscientious nature in regard to his job. He comes in early, stays late, works outages and ballgames all while keeping a positive attitude. Rick is respected by his fellow coworkers and even though they are shorthanded, he manages the work load of his crew and they always get the job done. He is always kind and courteous to students, faculty, staff, vendors and contractors and he excels inside the office as well as out in the field. Rick is very safety conscious and knowledgeable, and always makes the safety of his crew a top priority. He is on call almost 365 days of the year, he is the first one here and the last to leave, and truly cares about the campus and the work he is doing.    Our winners this year, Joel and Rick, are both great examples of the excellence all of us here at Facilities Services strive to achieve,    said Dave Irvin.
