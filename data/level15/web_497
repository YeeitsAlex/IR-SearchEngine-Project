          Twice a year, the Office of the Provost hosts Mic/Nite, a “Pecha-Kucha Powered” social gathering designed to enhance the intellectual, interdisciplinary, and cultural life of the faculty and staff at UT Knoxville.
         </p>
         <p>
          One of the challenges in a large university community is working across the silos that often separate disciplines. Mic/Nite offers an opportunity to build bridges and foster a deeper appreciation of the many facets of a large, comprehensive university. Presentations offer a cross section of the intellectual life of UT Knoxville and provide an opportunity for social interaction among faculty members who may not otherwise have the opportunity to interact with each other.
         </p>
         <p>
          Parking is available behind the venue on Anderson Avenue and on surrounding streets.
         </p>
         <p class="p1">
          <span class="s1">
           Free pizza and a cash bar are available. So we are able to make appropriate preparations, please RSVP!

           INTERIORITY
          </em>
          today is an exponentially evolving condition that requires invention to rethink the spatial environments we dwell in. This necessitates looking outside conventional design workflows. It is no longer sufficient to think about a mere visual connection between interior and exterior. Interior design concepts are to initiate an exterior/interior continuum, and position interior occupancy at the core of urban ecologies. Interior space is not autonomous; interiority thrives within the narratives it fosters, and amidst the milieus it occupies.
         </p>

          <em>
           _INTERIOR TOPOGRAPHIES
          </em>
          define a conceptual design framework, establishing an analogous link between interior and exterior while encouraging a unique receptiveness to occupancy. Here, inside and outside designations degrade, and a fertile elasticity between interior and exterior forms, ushering a liminal domain that demands the designer’s attention and imagination. Now more than ever, such a reciprocity is requisite in an era ubiquitous with the flatness of virtual imagery and an overall contextual banality.

          Diagnosis and prevalence of neurodevelopmental disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorders are increasing in the United States and all over the world. Many factors including general awareness of symptoms, better tracking of developmental milestones and meteoric rise and easy accessibility of DNA sequencing technologies (23&amp; Me, ancestry.com, genetic counseling etc.), contribute to this increase. I am interested in understanding the connections between neurological disorders and DNA. Specifically, we study how Rett Syndrome, a neurological disorder, is caused by mutations in a gene called MECP2. Rett Syndrome has a higher prevalence in girls. Many girls with Rett Syndrome exhibit atypical speech and social communication, movement and sensory perception issues. How these particular features arise in girls with Rett Syndrome due to MECP2 mutations is unknown. In my talk, I share with you our approach and results in brain development and function that take us a step closer to solving this mystery.

          This lecture poses a simple question. Why are Nationwide commercials so sad? Is it their form? Is it the relationship they have to sincerity? Is it the embedded hope of talent made manifest? Is it the antagonism that lies between art and commerce? Between music and emotions? Are the commercials actually sad?
         </p>
         <p>
          Attempts to find answers to these questions hold potential for revelation…far more than answers themselves. This pecha kucha is an exploration into forms of research that are as much inward looking as they are outward looking. Indeed, looking, listening, thinking and being are the foundations of Bienko’s artistic research, the output of which lies suspended in purposeful conflict with itself, somewhere between joy and pain.

          Competition to win a prize is a great motivator, but nearly every competition has rules or norms that define prohibited actions as cheating. Doping by athletes, fraud by sales staff seeking a bonus or promotion, and even plagiarism by faculty competing for tenure, can all be seen as damaging behavior by contestants. Deterring such behavior is a challenge for any organization using competition to drive extraordinary performance.
         </p>
         <p>
          Game theory can help us understand incentives for cheating and other strategic behavior in contests, and therefore how to more effectively deter unwanted behavior. Particularly in contests among small groups of fairly evenly matched competitors, it is crucial to model how players respond based on their beliefs about the cheating of others. Of course better policing—more frequent or more informative inspections of players’ actions—can deter cheating. But policing is limited by resources and technology for detecting cheating, and other factors are also important. If the top performer is caught cheating, should the prize be awarded to the second place finisher? If multiple contests are organized and resources limit the share of players who are inspected, is it better to inspect some players at every event or all players at some events and none at others? More fundamentally, what actions should be prohibited and trigger disqualification for cheating—is zero tolerance of harmful actions best, or might tolerating some bad behavior reduce more serious offenses?

          In the mass-media era, advertising spending has been linked to presidential election outcomes – the candidate who spends the most is highly likely to win the election. Furthermore, negative media coverage – often associated with personal scandals – has historically been shown to reduce a candidate’s likelihood of winning an election. In the U.S. election of 2016, the candidate who spent the least and who had significant personal scandals was elected president. This presentation examines digital persuasion strategies and uses big-data analytics to examine why. The 2016 U.S. presidential campaign may represent a “tipping point” between “old” mass media campaigning tactics such as spending on advertising and gaining positive media coverage and “new” approaches to winning elections and selling products and services by influencing the volume and valence of citizen/consumer digital engagement on social media.

          Place-based education is an educational approach dedicated to instilling place-consciousness and, correspondingly, pro-ecological attitudes and behaviors by
          <em>
           rooting
          </em>
          education within the local environment. But how can education become “rooted” in place when place itself is increasingly ephemeral or nonexistent—as non-place? Augé defined “non-place” as space lacking meaningful relations with other spaces, historical presence, or concern with identity. Rather than space as historically-centered, non-place represents a de-centering of space, a movement away from cities, dwelling places and dwelling-in-places, into capitalist, often technologically-mediated, spaces of “circulation, consumption, and communication.” As non-place represents a form of easy transit, disembodiment, and pseudo-living, the arts might serve as a counterpoint, offering enhanced perception, feeling, and imagination. Through place-based art education, students might engage in place-identifying, discovering the uniqueness of their communities; place-connecting, forming aesthetic, empathetic relations with the human and more-than-human world; and placemaking, producing place through fresh artistic forms and relations.

          Despite significant growth in installed renewable energy capacity, nuclear power provides upwards of 60% of the carbon-free electricity generation in the United States. Our current fleet of large, light-water cooled reactors are likely to be retired during the first half of the twenty-first century. The next generation of nuclear reactors will be significantly different than our current fleet, with new coolants, new fuels, and new deployment scenarios. These innovative designs come with opportunities to operate, manage, and maintain our reactors in fundamentally different ways, improving the economic outlook for nuclear power while providing clean, safe, reliable electricity.

          The Institute for Advanced Composites Manufacturing Innovation was established by The University of Tennessee and Oak Ridge National Laboratory as a National Manufacturing Innovation Institute to develop next generation composites for structural applications. Carbon fibers in composite form are targeted for high volume applications in wind, automotive, and compressed gas storage application space with infrastructure applications to follow. As these new materials evolve, characterization based manufacturing and optimization becomes a key for its rapid success and commercialization. Fiber reinforced polymer composites, especially carbon fiber reinforced materials, offer a number of opportunities to design light weight structures that are fatigue tolerant, corrosion resistant, cost effective. They offer the unique advantage to tailor the desired mechanical properties in target directions. This talk will introduce the audience to low-cost carbon fiber and composites, which are expected to be game changers for wide adoption in various light-weight engineering applications including your bicycles!

          Virginia P. Moore was Tennessee’s first home demonstration agent. Moore began working with Tennessee’s Department of Education to improve the condition of the state’s rural public schools in 1909. She then became a State Collaborator, expanding her work to include the organization of canning clubs for young girls across the state where she taught them to grow and can their own produce. With the Smith-Lever Act in 1914, which established extension services at land-grant universities, Moore joined the Division of Extension at University of Tennessee’s College of Agriculture to oversee home demonstration work throughout the state. This support expanded her canning clubs to include broader home management skills like cooking, sewing, cleaning, and finances. Although relatively unknown, this presentation will show how Virginia P. Moore not only educated and empowered many young women but also influenced the educational and agricultural landscape of Tennessee in the early 20th century.

          The placenta is essential for development of the fetus and maintenance of pregnancy. Cellular communications between maternal and fetal tissues are critical to create an environment acclimated for fetal survival. Successful pregnancy requires modulation of the maternal immune system by the placenta, allowing survival of the genetically dissimilar fetus. Thus, dysfunction of maternal-fetal communication can contribute to detrimental effects and mortality of the fetus. Animal models of pregnancy have been used to elucidate the mechanisms of fetal-maternal interactions during times of both health and disease. Pregnant sheep are a long established model of human pregnancy due to similarities of nutrient transfer and fetal development that parallels that which is observed in the human gestation. These similarities allow the use of sheep to answer fundamental questions about fetal-maternal interaction during pregnancy including exploration of important human diseases such as zika virus infection.

Central St Knoxville, TN 39717 Contact  Joan Heminway, Mic Nite Coordinator Email  jheminwa@tennessee.eduPhone  865-974-3813 Twice a year, the Office of the Provost hosts Mic Nite, a    Pecha-Kucha Powered    social gathering designed to enhance the intellectual, interdisciplinary, and cultural life of the faculty and staff at UT Knoxville. One of the challenges in a large university community is working across the silos that often separate disciplines. Mic Nite offers an opportunity to build bridges and foster a deeper appreciation of the many facets of a large, comprehensive university. Presentations offer a cross section of the intellectual life of UT Knoxville and provide an opportunity for social interaction among faculty members who may not otherwise have the opportunity to interact with each other. Parking is available behind the venue on Anderson Avenue  and on surrounding streets. Free pizza and a cash bar are available. So we are able to make appropriate preparations, please RSVP!  button link= http   volweb.utk.edu  micnite rsvp   color= summitt  style= font-size 20px    RSVP for Upcoming Mic Nite  button  What is Pecha-Kucha? Pecha-Kucha is a simple presentation format that features twenty images displayed for twenty seconds each. The images automatically forward as the presenter talks. To learn more, visit the Pecha-Kucha FAQ. Samples are posted on the Pecha-Kucha Presentations page. The format originated in Tokyo, Japan. It was first introduced in 2003 and has spread to more than 400 cities around the world. The format allows presenters to depict and describe everything from urban design or economic theory to a series of photographs. Mic Nite is held in cooperation with PechaKucha Night Knoxville, which was started in 2011 to encourage intellectual and cultural dialogue. Mic Nites are special interdisciplinary events that facilitate dialogue between university faculty and staff by showcasing the academic pursuits of the campus. Explore Pecha Kucha events from around the world  PechaKucha 20x20 - Official Site   PechaKucha 20x20 - Knoxville   PechaKucha 20x20 - FAQ Spring 2019 Presentation Topics Interior Topographies  Towards a New Typology of Spatial Occupancy Rana Abudayyeh, Assistant Professor  College of Architecture and Design -  School of Interior Architecture _INTERIORITY today is an exponentially evolving condition that requires invention to rethink the spatial environments we dwell in. This necessitates looking outside conventional design workflows. It is no longer sufficient to think about a mere visual connection between interior and exterior. Interior design concepts are to initiate an exterior interior continuum, and position interior occupancy at the core of urban ecologies. Interior space is not autonomous  interiority thrives within the narratives it fosters, and amidst the milieus it occupies. _INTERIOR TOPOGRAPHIES define a conceptual design framework, establishing an analogous link between interior and exterior while encouraging a unique receptiveness to occupancy. Here, inside and outside designations degrade, and a fertile elasticity between interior and exterior forms, ushering a liminal domain that demands the designer   s attention and imagination. Now more than ever, such a reciprocity is requisite in an era ubiquitous with the flatness of virtual imagery and an overall contextual banality.   Neurological Disorders and Brain Plasticity Keerthi Krishnan, Assistant Professor  College of Arts and Sciences - Biochemistry & Cellular and Molecular Biology Diagnosis and prevalence of neurodevelopmental disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorders are increasing in the United States and all over the world. Many factors including general awareness of symptoms, better tracking of developmental milestones and meteoric rise and easy accessibility of DNA sequencing technologies (23& Me, ancestry.com, genetic counseling etc.), contribute to this increase. I am interested in understanding the connections between neurological disorders and DNA. Specifically, we study how Rett Syndrome, a neurological disorder, is caused by mutations in a gene called MECP2. Rett Syndrome has a higher prevalence in girls. Many girls with Rett Syndrome exhibit atypical speech and social communication, movement and sensory perception issues. How these particular features arise in girls with Rett Syndrome due to MECP2 mutations is unknown. In my talk, I share with you our approach and results in brain development and function that take us a step closer to solving this mystery. You Know Those Nationwide Commercials with the People Singing Real Sincerely About Insurance? Why Are They So Heartbreaking? Joshua Bienko, Associate Professor  College of Arts and Sciences, School of Art - Drawing and Extended Media This lecture poses a simple question. Why are Nationwide commercials so sad? Is it their form? Is it the relationship they have to sincerity? Is it the embedded hope of talent made manifest? Is it the antagonism that lies between art and commerce? Between music and emotions? Are the commercials actually sad?   Attempts to find answers to these questions hold potential for revelation...far more than answers themselves. This pecha kucha is an exploration into forms of research that are as much inward looking as they are  outward looking. Indeed, looking, listening, thinking and being are the foundations of Bienko   s artistic research, the output of which lies suspended in purposeful  conflict with itself, somewhere between joy and pain.   The Dark Side of Competition Scott M. Gilpatric, Professor and Director of Graduate Studies, John and Shirley Moore Scholar  Haslam College of Business - Department of Economics    Competition to win a prize is a great motivator, but nearly every competition has rules or norms that define prohibited actions as cheating. Doping by athletes, fraud by sales staff seeking a bonus or promotion, and even plagiarism by faculty competing for tenure, can all be seen as damaging behavior by contestants. Deterring such behavior is a challenge for any organization using competition to drive extraordinary performance. Game theory can help us understand incentives for cheating and other strategic behavior in contests, and therefore how to more effectively deter unwanted behavior. Particularly in contests among small groups of fairly evenly matched competitors, it is crucial to model how players respond based on their beliefs about the cheating of others. Of course better policing   more frequent or more informative inspections of players    actions   can deter cheating. But policing is limited by resources and technology for detecting cheating, and other factors are also important. If the top performer is caught cheating, should the prize be awarded to the second place finisher? If multiple contests are organized and resources limit the share of players who are inspected, is it better to inspect some players at every event or all players at some events and none at others? More fundamentally, what actions should be prohibited and trigger disqualification for cheating   is zero tolerance of harmful actions best, or might tolerating some bad behavior reduce more serious offenses? Spending, Spinning, and Being Social  New Rules for the Persuasion Game Sally J. McMillan, Professor  College of Communication and Information - Advertising and Public Relations In the mass-media era, advertising spending has been linked to presidential election outcomes     the candidate who spends the most is highly likely to win the election. Furthermore, negative media coverage     often associated with personal scandals     has historically been shown to reduce a candidate   s likelihood of winning an election. In the U.S. election of 2016, the candidate who spent the least and who had significant personal scandals was elected president. This presentation examines digital persuasion strategies and uses big-data analytics to examine why. The 2016 U.S. presidential campaign may represent a    tipping point    between    old    mass media campaigning tactics such as spending on advertising and gaining positive media coverage and    new    approaches to winning elections and selling products and services by influencing the volume and valence of citizen consumer digital engagement on social media. Place-Based Art Education  Saving the World One Non-Place at a Time Joy Bertling, Assistant Professor  College of Education, Health, and Human Sciences    Place-based education is an educational approach dedicated to instilling place-consciousness and, correspondingly, pro-ecological attitudes and behaviors by rooting education within the local environment. But how can education become    rooted    in place when place itself is increasingly ephemeral or nonexistent   as non-place? Aug   defined    non-place    as space lacking meaningful relations with other spaces, historical presence, or concern with identity. Rather than space as historically-centered, non-place represents a de-centering of space, a movement away from cities, dwelling places and dwelling-in-places, into capitalist, often technologically-mediated, spaces of    circulation, consumption, and communication.    As non-place represents a form of easy transit, disembodiment, and pseudo-living, the arts might serve as a counterpoint, offering enhanced perception, feeling, and imagination. Through place-based art education, students might engage in place-identifying, discovering the uniqueness of their communities  place-connecting, forming aesthetic, empathetic relations with the human and more-than-human world  and placemaking, producing place through fresh artistic forms and relations. Nuclear Power for the 21st Century  Not Your Grandparent   s Reactor Jamie Coble, Assistant Professor  Tickle College of Engineering Despite significant growth in installed renewable energy capacity, nuclear power provides upwards of 60% of the carbon-free electricity generation in the United States. Our current fleet of large, light-water cooled reactors are likely to be retired during the first half of the twenty-first century. The next generation of nuclear reactors will be significantly different than our current fleet, with new coolants, new fuels, and new deployment scenarios. These innovative designs come with opportunities to operate, manage, and maintain our reactors in fundamentally different ways, improving the economic outlook for nuclear power while providing clean, safe, reliable electricity. Low Cost Carbon Fiber and Polymer Reinforced Composites  Is this the Game Changer? Dayakar Penumadu, Fred N. Peebles Professor  Tickle College of Engineering - Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering The Institute for Advanced Composites Manufacturing Innovation was established by The University of Tennessee and Oak Ridge National Laboratory as a National Manufacturing Innovation Institute to develop next generation composites for structural applications. Carbon fibers in composite form are targeted for high volume applications in wind, automotive, and compressed gas storage application space with infrastructure applications to follow. As these new materials evolve, characterization based manufacturing and optimization becomes a key for its rapid success and commercialization. Fiber reinforced polymer composites, especially carbon fiber reinforced materials, offer a number of opportunities to design light weight structures that are fatigue tolerant, corrosion resistant, cost effective. They offer the unique advantage to tailor the desired mechanical properties in target directions. This talk will introduce the audience to low-cost carbon fiber and composites, which are expected to be game changers for wide adoption in various light-weight engineering applications including your bicycles! Virginia P. Moore  Tennessee   s First Home Demonstration Agent Laura Romans, Manuscripts Archivist & Assistant Professor  University Libraries    Virginia P. Moore was Tennessee   s first home demonstration agent. Moore began working with Tennessee   s Department of Education to improve the condition of the state   s rural public schools in 1909. She then became a State Collaborator, expanding her work to include the organization of canning clubs for young girls across the state where she taught them to grow and can their own produce. With the Smith-Lever Act in 1914, which established extension services at land-grant universities, Moore joined the Division of Extension at University of Tennessee   s College of Agriculture to oversee home demonstration work throughout the state. This support expanded her canning clubs to include broader home management skills like cooking, sewing, cleaning, and finances. Although relatively unknown, this presentation will show how Virginia P. Moore not only educated and empowered many young women but also influenced the educational and agricultural landscape of Tennessee in the early 20th century. The Immune-Paradox of Pregnancy  What Can We Learn from Sheep? Andrea Lear, Assistant Professor  College of Veterinary Medicine, Large Animal Clinical Sciences - Farm Animal Field Services    The placenta is essential for development of the fetus and maintenance of pregnancy. Cellular communications between maternal and fetal tissues are critical to create an environment acclimated for fetal survival. Successful pregnancy requires modulation of the maternal immune system by the placenta, allowing survival of the genetically dissimilar fetus. Thus, dysfunction of maternal-fetal communication can contribute to detrimental effects and mortality of the fetus. Animal models of pregnancy have been used to elucidate the mechanisms of fetal-maternal interactions during times of both health and disease. Pregnant sheep are a long established model of human pregnancy due to similarities of nutrient transfer and fetal development that parallels that which is observed in the human gestation. These similarities allow the use of sheep to answer fundamental questions about fetal-maternal interaction during pregnancy including exploration of important human diseases such as zika virus infection.","link":"http:\/\/volweb.utk.edu\/~micnite\/"},{"title":"Information for Presenters","content":"Information for Presenters Welcome to the Presenters  Area of the Mic Nite site!  Read on for recommendations and instructions. What is PechaKucha? A presentation with 20 slides, set at 20 seconds each. The slides advance automatically while you speak.No transitions or slide animations are used between slides.From the inventors of PechaKucha   The key to a great presentation is to present something you love. Most people use PechaKucha Night to present their latest creative projects or work.  Recommendations Budget 35-40 spoken words per slide    so you can speak comfortably.Keep slide text at a minimum. If you use text, go big  18-24pt or higher will be readable from the audience seats.   Whenever possible, choose only one image per slide, set to the full size of the slide. Simple is better  the seconds will be flying by for both you and the audience!Use your own images, or images you have permission to use. If you need additional graphics, avoid copyrighted images by using the Creative Commons image search or signing up at Pixabay.To avoid blurry images, choose medium or large photos (at 96 dpi or higher) and test your presentation on a large monitor or projector.It is always advisable to credit the source of your image regardless of its copyright status. This information can be added in smaller text at the bottom of the slide, or can be included in a text file that you upload below along with your presentation.Still images are preferred, but if appropriate to the material, video or audio can be used in one or two 20-second clips.Practice the full presentation, timed, with a friend or colleague. The PechaKucha format will seem unusual at first. Plan for multiple rounds of revisions to really get a sense of how your message will fare in 20-second blocks. Working with the Template A title slide is already included in the template, and it doesn t count against the 20-slide total. The title slide will show on screen while you walk up to the stage and ready yourself. You will hear a 5 second countdown while the numbers count down on the screen, and then your presentation will start. Use good margins on your PowerPoint slides to ensure no information is lost to the edge of the screen, shadows, roaming attendees, etc.Background color and font color should contrast. This is hard to read.Once all presentations have been uploaded, I ll work with each presenter on any remaining questions, then create a compressed version. Presentations cannot be altered after this point  I will be bringing all presentation files to the event. Night of the Event Plan to show up at Relix Variety Theatre at 5 30pm for the social hour and to meet the other presenters. The front row of the theatre will be reserved for your seating to assist in the smooth transitions between speakers. No speakers are introduced before their presentations, so this is a fairly    rapid fire    event. The presentations will be run from a laptop in the sound booth, so you won t be able to see the Powerpoint notes. Many people bring index cards or a small piece of paper with notes if needed.We will videotape the Mic Nite presentations, and they will be posted to the Mic Nite UTK youtube channel.     If you have further questions about the PowerPoint template, image resolution, copyright, or other presentation topics, please contact Susannah Finley or Meg Erlewine   .
