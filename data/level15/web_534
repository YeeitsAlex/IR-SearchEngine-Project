       While we use state-of-the-art security, no system can guard against risks of intentional intrusion or inadvertent disclosure of information.
       <strong>
        When using Patient Portal, information may be transmitted over media that are beyond the control of the Practice Entities and their contractors and subcontractors and that may not be secure.
       </strong>
       For example, you may receive email, text, or telephone communications in connection with your use of Patient Portal, all of which are inherently unsecure and subject to disclosure to or access by third parties (e.g., if your phone is used by someone else, you do not keep your phone or email information up to date on Patient Portal and communications are misdirected, or the network or systems of a telecommunications provider are hacked).
       <strong>
        Furthermore, electronic services such as those provided by the Practice Entities, their contractors and subcontractors, and any telecommunications providers involved in the transmission of data are all inherently subject to failure and none of the foregoing can guarantee that their services will be provided without error or interruption at all times that you may wish to use those services. YOU HEREBY EXPRESSLY ASSUME THE RISK OF ANY UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OR INTENTIONAL INTRUSION, OR OF ANY DELAY, FAILURE, INTERRUPTION, OR CORRUPTION OF DATA OR OTHER INFORMATION TRANSMITTED IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF ANY SERVICE RELATED TO PATIENT PORTAL.
       </strong>
       Once information is received by us, your medical information will be treated as confidential and given the same protection that all of our other medical records are given.

     Security, Confidentiality, and Usage Guidelines for Patient Portal
    </h3>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <strong>
       YOU MUST NOT SEND ANY MESSAGES REQUIRING URGENT ATTENTION USING PATIENT PORTAL.
      </strong>
      Doing so may create a delay in your receiving necessary medical treatment and could result in loss of life, permanent injury, or significant deterioration in your health. If you believe that you have an urgent medical matter, you should call 911 immediately or proceed to the nearest emergency room. If the matter is not urgent but you need a response in less than two business days, please contact your clinician's office directly by telephone during our regular business hours, which you may find on the log-in screen for Patient Portal.
      <br/>
      <h2 class="style5">
       FOR ALL MEDICAL EMERGENCIES, IMMEDIATELY CALL 911
      </h2>

     </li>
     <li>
      Patient portal is designed as a secure Internet-based environment through which you may receive confidential medical information about yourself. When you initially enroll to use the Patient Portal, you will need to confirm your identity via two unique workflows, as well as establish an email and a confidential password for login credentials. Please
      <strong>
       DO NOT SHARE YOUR PASSWORD
      </strong>
      with anyone. Anyone with access to your password will be able to view your medical and financial information and communicate with your health care team as if that person were you. Thus, when you give someone your password, you are authorizing that person to access your account, and you are responsible for all transactions that person performs while using your service. It is your responsibility to prevent disclosure of your password and to change your password if you feel that your security has been compromised. If you believe that your password has become known to an unauthorized person and want verification of any changes that may have been made to your account, please contact us for assistance. You can change your password in the Patient Portal at any time by clicking the "Security Settings" link under "My Profile."
      <br/>
      <br/>
     </li>
     <li>
      You may request a Patient Portal account for yourself. You may not request or access a Patient Portal account for anyone else, except that a parent or guardian may request and access an account on behalf of a minor child. By accepting these terms and conditions, you certify that you are authorized to open or access the account you are requesting and that all information you have provided to us is true and correct to the best of your knowledge.
      <br/>
      <br/>
     </li>
     <li>
      Once you have activated your Patient Portal account, the Patient Portal Inbox will become the primary vehicle to receive important messages from your participating provider(s) and other personal medical information.
      <strong>
       You MUST provide us with your email address when activating your Patient Portal account and keep your email address current via the My Profile link
      </strong>
      , to ensure that you receive notification of newly released information in a timely manner. You may continue to receive communications via the United States Postal Service or other means from us.

It is your responsibility to login to your Patient Portal account and read the messages promptly.
     </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
     Your Responsibilities
    </h3>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Patient Portal is a communication service offered as a convenience to our patients. We reserve the right to change the terms, conditions, and notices under which Patient Portal is offered. By accessing or using Patient Portal, you further agree that any and all such modifications are effective and binding upon you immediately upon posting of the modified version. We reserve the right in the future to charge a fee for the use of Patient Portal. You will be notified in advance of any such change and asked to re-apply if you agree to the fee and wish to continue with the Patient Portal service.
      <br/>
      <br/>
     </li>
     <li>
      You understand that by accepting the terms and conditions of this Agreement you are agreeing to receive your patient balance statements delivered electronically to your Patient Portal account. You have the option at any time to revert back to receiving your patient balance statements as paper statements sent to you via U.S. Mail. You may exercise that option by checking the appropriate checkbox located at the bottom of the Billing Tab in Patient Portal under "Patient Preferences."
      <br/>
      <br/>
     </li>
     <li>
      You acknowledge that by entering your home and/or mobile telephone number into Patient Portal you are providing written consent for the Practice Entities to send automated, prerecorded, or artificial voice telephone calls to all provided numbers. You may opt-out of receiving these calls on the "Contact Preferences" page, located under the My Profile tab.
     </li>
     <li>
      You understand that Patient Portal provides you with online access to some clinical information about you. You are solely responsible for any sharing of Patient Portal content that you intentionally or unintentionally communicate to others.
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    </p>
    <h3>
     Patient Portal Messaging
    </h3>
    <ul>
     <li>
      By using Patient Portal, you acknowledge and agree that this messaging service is intended to facilitate dialogue regarding personal health matters. You agree not to use Patient Portal to post or send or post any illicit or offensive material.
      <br/>
      <br/>
     </li>
     <li>
      You understand that messages will be routed to the appropriate department as necessary for handling, and therefore our employees other than your physician, nurse practitioner, or physician's assistant may be involved in addressing your request. If your physician is out of the office or unavailable to respond, messages sent via Patient Portal may be routed to other authorized healthcare providers within our practice to facilitate a timely response to your request. Therefore, use of Patient Portal may not be appropriate if there is sensitive information that you want to discuss directly with your healthcare provider.
      <br/>
      <br/>
     </li>
     <li>
      You understand that your health care team may send you messages, test results, and other communications via Patient Portal as authorized in the sole discretion of your physician. These messages may contain information important to your health and medical care. It is your responsibility to monitor these messages. By entering your valid and functional email address at registration, you have enabled us to notify you of messages sent to your Patient Portal Inbox.
     </li>
    </ul>

     <li>
      We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to limit or discontinue your use of Patient Portal at any time and for any reason, including, but not limited to, your use of Patient Portal on behalf of another person.
      <br/>
      <br/>
     </li>
     <li>
      Your Patient Portal service will be discontinued if you no longer have a primary care provider who participates in Patient Portal at your practice.
      <br/>
      <br/>
     </li>
     <li>
      You will be notified if your Patient Portal service is discontinued.

  You can create a family or guarantor login account that will allow you to access selected family members' health information within the same login account. "Family" access gives you the same access to patient information and actions as you do with your own patient web portal account. "Guarantor" access gives you the ability to view contact and billing information and make payments on the patients' behalf.
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   In order to setup an account of this nature, the patient to which you are requesting access will need to log in to their patient web portal account and grant access using the following steps. If you know the login information for this patient, such as your child, log into their web portal account.
  </li>
  <li>
   Go to the "My Profile" tab and click on "Family/Guarantor Access."
  </li>
  <li>
   Enter the e-mail address of the family member and click on "Go."
  </li>
  <li>
   Select an Account Type of "Family" or "Guarantor", fill in the required fields, and click on "Submit."
  </li>
  <li>
   A temporary password will appear in a pop up screen. Write this password down and forward it to the family member, as it will not be available after clicking on "ok."
  </li>
  <li>
   The family member's name will then be listed under the "Family" or "Guarantor" section at the top of the screen.
  </li>
  <li>
   To edit or remove this family member's access, click on the family member's name at the top of the screen.
  </li>
  <li>
   To sign into this family or guarantor account, check the "Sign in to your family or guarantor account" box on the Sign In screen, type in your email address and password, then click Sign In. Once singed in, you must change your password and accept the terms and conditions to view the account.
