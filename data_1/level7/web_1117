Following Suspension, Instructure and your applicable Entity will work in good faith to determine whether to reinstate your access to (and any associated licenses to) the Services or permanently terminate your Services, such determination to be made by your Entity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Instructure may terminate your account in its sole discretion in the event that (a) you are a repeat infringer for purposes of Instructure’s copyright infringement policy as described in Section 11 or (b) you violate a restriction in Section 1.2 and, after Instructure makes reasonable efforts to provide you with notice of such violation, you violate Section 1.2 a subsequent time. You agree that Instructure shall not be liable to you for any Suspensions or terminations made in accordance with the Terms. Termination or Suspension of any Service may include removal of access to such Service and barring of further use of the Service. Termination (but not Suspension) of all Services also may include deletion of your password and all related information, files and Content associated with or inside your Account (or any part thereof), including Your Content. Upon termination of any Service for all customers, or in the event that Instructure’s agreement with your Entity or with a facilitator that has an agreement with Instructure and with your Entity, terminates (unless Instructure at approximately the same time enters into a new agreement with your Entity), your right to use such Service will automatically terminate immediately. Instructure will not have any liability whatsoever to you for any Suspension or termination, including for deletion of Your Content. All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive, shall survive termination of Services, including without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, and limitation of liability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e13.
