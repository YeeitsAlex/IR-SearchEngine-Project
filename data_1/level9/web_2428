             Questions abound after Trump threatens to strip funding from colleges that don't support free speech

            President Trump's announcement Saturday that he would cut funding to universities that don't agree to protect free speech has been met with favor and dismay, depending on observers' viewpoints. For the second time in making such a threat, the president pointed to
            <b>
             Berkeley
            </b>
            as an example of why such a policy is required. This time, he brought to the stage the victim of a recent assault that occurred on campus, suggesting that the victim should sue the university and the state. The campus responded with a lengthy statement, informing the community and public about why the assault was not a free speech case, along with a detailed account of how the campus has handled the situation. As this article points out, the president's threat raises questions, such as: "Was this political rhetoric, or an imminent policy change? What would qualify as a commitment to free speech, and who would get to decide? And what money was in question -- research funding or tuition grants for low-income students?" Peter McPherson, president of the Associate of Public and Land-grant Universities, said in a statement: "An executive order is unnecessary as public research universities are already bound by the First Amendment, which they deeply respect and honor. ... It is core to their academic mission." Berkeley officials couldn't agree more. This article provides a brief history of Berkeley's efforts to protect free speech in recent years.

            is one of two published in the past week, suggesting that President Trump's tariffs are a risky experiment. The study, co-authored with World Bank chief economist Pinelopi Goldberg and economists from UCLA and Columbia, projects that annual losses just from the higher cost of imports would cost the U.S. economy $68.8 billion, or almost 0.4 percent of gross domestic product. It also suggests that consumers and U.S. companies would be on the hook for most of the tariffs' costs, with the key victims to date being farmers and blue-collar workers in red states. "Workers in very Republican counties bore the brunt of the costs of the trade war, in part because retaliations disproportionately targeted agricultural sectors, and in part because U.S. tariffs raised the costs of inputs used by these counties," the economists wrote.

            recent decision to discontinue its costly subscriptions to Elsevier's academic publications, Heather Joseph, executive director of the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition, says: "It's a very important development. While a number of individual institutions have canceled their journal subscription with Elsevier, this is the first time an entire statewide system has done it. ... And perhaps even more importantly, the UC libraries made it clear that this decision isn't just about money. ... They're pushing for a new vision of sharing the knowledge, making sure that it's available to everyone and not just to those who can afford to pay."

            A proposed state measure that would make California the only state to restrict police officers' use of deadly force is gaining ground in the wake of the Stephon Clark killing. But some legal experts think that imposing a statewide standard might be counterproductive, since the only way to really change the trend is to have police adopt a different mindset on using force. Commenting on the measure, and referring to his book
            <i>
             When Police Kill
            </i>
            ,
            <b>
             law professor Franklin Zimring
            </b>
            says: "The key issues are not criminal prosecution standards but rules and incentives that police administration provides -- what my book calls 'don't shoot' and 'stop shooting' rules and values." The New York City Police Department has reduced fatal shootings by officers there by introducing tougher standards, training, and oversight, and Professor Zimring has praised their approach. This story appeared in more than 200 sources.
