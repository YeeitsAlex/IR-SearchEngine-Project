    <ul>
     <li>
      Through online course websites students have "anytime, anywhere" access to syllabi, course documents and files, and tools to interact with each other and with their instructors.  The necessary oversight, development, support and instructional design of the system of course websites are made possible by the IEI fees.
     </li>
     <li>
      Instructional websites and online software tools developed with faculty and TAs directly enrich student learning by providing discipline-specific online learning environments.
     </li>
     <li>
      Other aspects of online learning may include the continual upgrade of chat rooms, online office hours, slide shows, document annotation, links, the inclusion of video, easy access to digitized readings and other materials, online experimentation, blogging as a part of a course, online quizzes, access to materials from previous courses, discussion forums, and many other opportunities are made possible by the IEI fees.  Classes also may be streamed live or archived for future review.  Remote experts can be brought into classes through live connections, or classes around the world can be held together simultaneously using video.

      "Curated" workstations in staffed computing labs enable students to sit down at any workstation and have ready access to the software they need for their coursework.
     </li>
     <li>
      Wired and wireless networks in faculty and staff offices throughout the campus enable students and their instructors to access online course materials during office hours, to conduct online office hours, and to have the "anytime, anywhere" computing experience that students and faculty need and expect on campus.
     </li>
     <li>
      All academic divisions provide computer labs centrally and/or in the departments.  Some staff and the student assistants in the labs are paid through IEI fees.
     </li>
     <li>
      IEI fees support the Helpdesk operations in the computer labs.
     </li>
     <li>
      Printing services are available in the labs.
