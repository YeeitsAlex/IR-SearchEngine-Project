A full agenda will be coming this week.\n         \n\n           (Please note the earlier start time of 1:10pm).\n          \n\n          The Special Theme for the Winter 2019 Division Meeting is \"Introducing the Underground Scholars Initiative.\"\n         \n          The Underground Scholars Initiative has multiple chapters across the UC system, and has gained international recognition.  Founding members have been featured in a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview with Oprah Winfrey.  USI\u2019s goal is to build a pathway for formerly incarcerated and system impacted students to access and thrive in higher education.  UCR\u2019s Underground Scholars are contributing to the growth of our campus community by providing a supportive space for formerly incarcerated students to network, organize, and use their educational success as a counter-narrative to the many stereotypes they encounter on a daily basis.\n         \n          USI members are working closely with schools and community organizations in the Inland Empire that advocate on behalf of formerly incarcerated people and provide them with the necessary resources and opportunities to succeed. USI at UCR is especially dedicated to disrupting the flow of \u201cat-risk\u201d youth between schools and prisons, and provides mentorship programs for children and young adults in the Riverside community to enable their transition to higher education.\n         \n          I am honored to serve as the faculty co-advisor with Prof. Jo\u00e3o Costa Vargas (Anthropology) for the new UCR chapter of the Underground Scholars Initiative (USI).  Members of this campus organization have accepted my invitation to discuss USI\u2019s mission at the February 26 Division Meeting:\n          \n\n          I hope you will join me in welcoming these students and their new organization to our campus on February 26.\n         \n          Peace\n          \n          dylan\n         \n          Dear Faculty Colleagues,\n         \n          My thanks to the Basic Needs and Food Insecurity Working Group for speaking to the Special Theme at our December 4, 2018 Division Meeting.

I look forward to updating the campus on the Gen Ed Com\u2019s progress after it convenes.\n         \n\n           Charge\n          \n\n          Peace\n          \n          dylan\n         \n          Dear Faculty Colleagues,\n         \n          As I begin my sixth year as Chancellor, I remain as excited about UCR\u2019s future as when I first arrived. The talents and successes of the faculty created our national prominence and are what drew me to UCR in the first place.\n         \n          While the last five years have been exciting and rewarding, they have not been without their challenges. In response, I have tried to listen to the advice and feedback that I\u2019ve received and adjust my actions as appropriate; but I realize that additional improvements can always be made. It is in that spirit that I write to you, today.\n         \n          The Academic Senate solicited feedback on my first five years this past Spring. I read the resultant report carefully and am taking the advice that it contained seriously. Moving ahead, I look forward to future consultation with the Senate. I would also offer anyone with advice or perspective on how I might best serve the campus, a personal invitation to share their thoughts with me. A lot has changed in five years and what was apt in 2013 may not be as suitable today. Thus, I would appreciate continuing the dialogue about how I may best engage with all of our campus stakeholders today and beyond.\n         \n          I am always eager to meet with individuals or groups in person; but would also appreciate e-mails, notes, letters, or any mode that works for you.\n         \n          I look forward to your thoughts and to continue working on behalf of the university.\n         \n          Kim\n         \n          Hi everyone,\n         \n          I hope you\u2019ve had a solid summer and are ready for the new school year.  I\u2019m back for my 18th year as a UCR faculty member and the start of my second term (and 3rd year) as your Academic Senate Chair.  The most significant project to be undertaken by the Senate (and thus, all of us) in the coming year will be the full review of UCR\u2019s General Education curriculum, including a transformative reflection on our breadth requirements, collective pedagogical mission, and scholarly-intellectual obligations to a student body that is fundamentally different than it was during the last such full review (about 40 years ago!).  I look forward to the debate, creative sharing, and critical thought that will characterize this process.  I believe our work at UCR will be constructively altered by this work.\n         \n          I have once again made myself available to all departments on campus if you wish to invite me to one of your regularly scheduled faculty meetings.  (I never have an agenda for these visits, other than to re/introduce myself to everyone and engage in a collective conversation about whatever you wish to discuss.)  My email address is\n          \n           dylan.rodriguez@ucr.edu\n          \n          and my cell phone number is 951-756-4713.
